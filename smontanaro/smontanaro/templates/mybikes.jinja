    <p>
        I was mildly surprised to find that Google's web crawler
        doesn't crawl Google Photos. That means if I Google my Monti
        Special, it can't be found. Ditto for any other bike in my
        stable. What's up with that? So, I've put together this page
        to describe my various bikes and provide links to their albums
        in Google Photos.

            <dd>Arrived March 7 2020 (nice timing...) s/n 75T005. Was
            built upon with mostly Dura-Ace components (rescued from
            my former Schwinn Volare). As of Spring 2025 it is back to
            a bare frame.

            <dt><a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/auNis2Sw5DUBL8t88">Griffon</a></dt>
            <dd>Built by Jim Holly, not sure of the exact timeframe,
            but likely late 70s or early 80s. s/n 11123.</dd>
            <dt><a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/96eYWbEsWziTXw5SA">Italvega Super Speciale</a></dt>
            <dd>Had a couple Italvegas in the early- to mid-70s. When
            this one popped up on eBay, I had to snag it.</dd>
            <dt><a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/fm988mmGDELgzXSWA">Jim Redcay</a></dt>
            <dd>Jim Redcay was a custom framebuilder in New Jersey. He
            only wielded a torch under his own name for a few years,
            then took over the Ross Signature project when Tom Kellogg
            left to start Spectrum Cycles. My frame was built in 1979.</dd>
            <dt><a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/1o8uf6p4GcgP9Uc29">Dawes Galaxy</a></dt>
            <dd>Probably 1970-75 Galaxy. eBay find for $45. I
            originally thought I would just flip it, but never got
            around to pulling the trigger. After knocking around the
            garage for a long time, I used it as a stationary trainer
            during rehab after femur surgery in 2017. At that point,
            it found a soft spot in my heart. It has now become my
            beboppin' around town bike, displacing my Schwinn
            Speedster. In addition to being a whole lot lighter, it's
            got six (count 'em!) gears. What an improvement in spacing
            over the old wide range S-A three-speed hub.</dd>

            <dd>This is a rummage sale find, meant to be
            catch-and-release. It appears to be mostly original. It
            came with 27-inch clincher wheels with lower end Shimano
            hubs, but now at least has a wheelset with early Dura-Ace
            hubs.</dd>
            <dt><a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/ccWUC4SBc19A1w366">J.P. Weigle</a></dt>
            <dd>A gift from Weisan. It came to both him and me with a
            badly damaged downtube. I plan to repair it (or get it
            repaired) someday, hopefully soon.</dd>

            <dd>Mid-50s. I got it as <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/dbhV8XmoUVF1JS2K6">a mess</a>, moved it on as a bit <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/BfN5T67zzN2r5afC9">less

            <dt><a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/vkUqigWGJeAaDU5Z8">Frejus Tour de France</a></dt>
            <dd>My brother-in-law found this bike on a contracting job
            and dropped it off to see if I might be interested in it
            (saved from an almost inevitable trip to the dump). Heck
            yeah! A touch small for me perhaps, but I think I can
            probably squeeze onto it. :-) I originally thought this
            dated from the late 1950s, but looking at the Frejus
            serial number list on the Classic Rendezvous website, I
            think it might have been produced in the early 1960s.</dd>
