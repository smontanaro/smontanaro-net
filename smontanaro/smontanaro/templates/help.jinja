        You can do more than just browse the 180k or so messages in the archive.
        <ul>
            <li>When browsing by date or thread, you can search for
                particular content on your favorite search engine.</li>
            <li>When browsing by date you can search message content.</li>li>
            <li>When viewing a message, you can associate one or more
                topics with that message.</li>
            <li>You can browse the <a href="/CR/topics">current set of topics</a>.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <a name="search"><h2>Searching</h2></a>

    <p>
        You can search the full archive using your favorite search
        engine and its search syntax. The default search engine is
        Brave, but Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo are also supported. If
        you would like to see some other search engine available, let
        me know.
    </p>

    <p>
        You can also search a fairly crude index of the mail messages
        in the database.  This is far from perfect, but allows you to
        browse messages on a particular topic chronologically. For
        example, you might try searching for
        <a href="/CR/query?query=Ernesto+Colnago">Ernesto Colnago</a>.
    </p>

    <a name="topics"><h2>Browsing or Adding Topics</h2></a>

    <p>
        The archive is huge and is really not organized in a useful
        way. While filters help cut down on the sheer number of
        messages you need to consider when scanning the archive for
        messages of interest, a more permanent method of organization
        is called for. The archive has a user-maintained set of
        hierarchical topics. You can view
        <a href="/CR/topics">existing topics</a>, or (when
        viewing an individual message you find interesting) suggest
        one or more topics that message might apply to. Consider this
        message: <a href="/CR/2008/9/1111">reynolds 531 SL tubing and
        heavier riders</a>. You will see it's already associated with
        two
        <a href="/CR/topics/Framebuilding%3ANorris%20Lockley">Framebuilding:Norris Lockley</a>.
        You can suggest other topics to which that message might
        apply, say, "Framebuilding:Reynolds Tubing," by entering that
        in the "Add Topic(s)" field and hitting RETURN or pressing the
        "Submit" button. Hierarchy is indicated by using a colon (":")
        to separate more general topics from more specific
        subtopics. If you want to define multiple topics for a given
        message, separate them with commas.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is a very new feature (as of Feb 2022). At some point it
        might need further refinement.
