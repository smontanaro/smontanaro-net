        You can do more than just browse the 180k or so messages in the archive.
        <ul>
            <li>When browsing by date or thread, you can search for
                particular content on your favorite search engine.</li>
            <li>When browsing by date you can filter on message
                subjects or senders.</li>
            <li>When viewing a message, you can associate one or more
                topics with that message.</li>
            <li>You can browse the <a href="/CR/topics">current set of topics</a>.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <a name="search"><h2>Searching</h2></a>

    <p>
        You can search the full archive using your favorite search
        engine and its search syntax. The default search engine is
        Brave, but Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo are also supported. If
        you would like to see some other search engine available, let
        me know.
    </p>

    <a name="filter"><h2>Filtering</h2></a>

    <p>
        When browsing by date you probably won't be all that
        interested in messages about ancient eBay listings. Simiarly,
        you might want to only view messages about a particular brand
        or from a particular person. The filter function on the dates
        pages allow you to restrict your view accordingly. Select
        "Keep" or "Toss" from the dropdown menu, and enter a pattern,
        then click "Filter." For the nerds reading this, the pattern
        can be any regular expression, but a word or two works just
        fine.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that the filter capability is just a little hack. It
        doesn't operate on full messages, just the subject and
        sender. Each message listed has the subject and sender on a
        single line. The filter just keeps or tosses lines matching
        the desired pattern and displays those that make it through
        the filter.
    </p>

    <a name="filter-examples"><h2>Filter Pattern Examples</h2></a>

    <p>
        Here are a few simple regular expression examples. Note that
        patterns are not case-sensitive. "Colnago" and "colnago" match
        the same messages.
        <ul>
            <li><tt>ebay|fs|wtb|for sale</tt> - a pattern that selects
                many/most messages related to buying and selling</li>
            <li><tt>Colnago|Masi</tt> - a pattern that selects messages
                mentioning Colnago <b>or</b> Masi</li>
            <li><tt>(Colnago.*Masi|Masi.*Colnago)</tt> - a pattern
                that selects messages mentioning Colnago <b>and</b>
                Masi (admittedly, a bit cumbersome)</li>
            <li><tt>brian baylis</tt> - a pattern that selects messages
                from (or mentioning) Brian Baylis.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <a name="topics"><h2>Browsing or Adding Topics</h2></a>

    <p>
        The archive is huge and is really not organized in a useful
        way. While filters help cut down on the sheer number of
        messages you need to consider when drilling down on a subject
        of interest, a more permanent method of organization is called
        for. The archive has a user-maintained set of topics. You can
        view <a href="/CR/topics">existing topics</a>, or (when
        viewing an individual message you find interesting) suggest
        one or more topics that message might apply to. Consider this
        message: <a href="CR/2008/9/1111">reynolds 531 SL tubing and
        heavier riders</a>. You will see it's already associated with
        two topics, <a href="/CR/topics/Framebuilding">Framebuilding</a>
        and <a href="/CR/topics/Norris%20Lockley">Norris Lockley</a>. You
        can suggest other topics to which that message might apply,
        say, "Reynolds Tubing," by entering that in the "Add Topic(s)"
        field and hitting RETURN or pressing the "Submit" button. If
        you want to add the same message to multiple topics, separate
        them with commas.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is a very new feature (as of Feb 2022). At some point it
        will probably need to undergo some further refinement.
