        You can do more than just browse the 180k or so messages in the archive.

            <li>When browsing by date or thread, you can search for
                particular content on your favorite search engine.</li>
            <li>When browsing by date you can filter on message
                subjects or senders.</li>
            <li>When viewing a message, you can associate one or more
                topics with that message.</li>
            <li>You can browse the <a href="/CR/topics">current set of topics</a>.</li>

    <p>
        You can search the full archive using your favorite search engine
        and its search syntax. The default search engine is Brave, but
        Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo are also supported.
    </p>

    <a name="filter"><h2>Filtering</h2></a>

    <p>
        When browsing by date you probably won't be all that
        interested in messages about ancient eBay listings. Simiarly,
        you might want to only view messages about a particular brand
        or from a particular person. The filter function on the dates
        pages allow you to restrict your view accordingly. Select
        "Keep" or "Toss" from the dropdown menu, and enter a pattern,
        then click "Filter." For the nerds reading this, the pattern
        can be any regular expression, but a word or two works just
        fine.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that the filter capability is just a little hack. It
        doesn't operate on full messages, just the subject and
        sender. Each message listed has the subject and sender on a
        single line. The filter just keeps or tosses lines matching
        the desired pattern and displays those that make it through
        the filter.
