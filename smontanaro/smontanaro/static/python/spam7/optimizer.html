<H2 align=center>Abstract </H2>

<p> This paper describes the implementation of a peephole optimizer for
Python byte codes.  Python's byte code compiler currently generates code
that can easily be improved. The peephole optimizer implemented presented
here implements a number of common optimizations, including jump chaining,
constant expression evaluation and elimination of unecessary loads.  Some
optimizations rely on specific properties of Python or its virtual machine.
Some optimizations common to statically typed languages, such as algebraic
simplification and expression rearrangement, are prevented by Python's
dynamic typing.

Preliminary results obtained using pybench&nbsp;[Lemb] suggest
that the optimizer has a positive benefit for specific operations.  With the
current measurement tools available however, it is difficult to quantify
benefits that can be derived by using the optimizer.  Situations in which
the benchmarks may not yield reliable results are considered.  The
limitations Python places on the optimizer are discussed, especially
restrictions caused by the dynamic nature of the language. Other performance
improvements to the Python interpreter are discussed briefly.

<H2 align=center>Introduction </H2>

<p> Python code is compiled to a high-level virtual machine in a straightforward
fashion.  We should be able to apply a peephole optimizer to the code to
improve performance. This paper investigates an experimental peephole
optimizer written in Python which is integrated with the existing byte
compiler.

<p> In general, a peephole optimizer searches for patterns of opcodes that can
be replaced by more efficient ones.  Peephole optimization works because it
can "see" more of the instruction stream at once than the compiler can
during code generation.  For instance, the simple

<pre>
x = hairy_calc()
y = x + 15
</pre>

would generate a store into x followed by an immediate load from x.  The
compiler wouldn't know to make a copy of the function value on the stack
before storing it in x because it hasn't yet seen the statement after the
one it is compiling.  A peephole optimizer will see a very simple pattern:

<pre>
STORE x
LOAD x
</pre>

which it can replace with:

<pre>
DUP_TOP
STORE x
</pre>

(A notation similar to that generated by the <a
href="/~skip/python/Python/dist/src/Lib/dis.py">Python
disassembler</a> is used in this paper.  Labels and statement addresses are
omitted and variable references are simplified.)

<p> Two obvious optimizations are implemented by the byte code compiler
itself.  When Python is run with the -O flag, SET_LINENO opcodes and code to
implement assert statements are not generated. There is much more that can
be done, however. Some common constructs such as tuple assignments, while
convenient for the programmer

<pre>
a,b,c = 1,2,3
</pre>

yield inefficient code which can easily be improved.

<p> Peephole optimization of Python byte code is performed by the xfreeze
module&nbsp;[Tutt], a contributed enhancement of the freeze module available
from the Python Software Association's web site&nbsp;[PSA]. Several of the
optimizations implemented here were derived from those found in xfreeze.
Unfortunately, xfreeze is a specialized program mixing two purposes:
optimizing byte code and binding a Python interpreter and a set of
associated modules into a single monolithic executable.  The relative rarity
of the latter task means the optimizations it performs get little use.

<h2 align=center>Byte Code Interpreter</h2>

<p> Python code is compiled into virtual machine code, that is, code that
defines a computer that is not realized in hardware, but is executed at
run-time by a byte code interpreter.  Python's virtual machine is
stack-oriented.  With one exception, all instructions operate on the top one
to three Python objects on the stack or transfer objects between the stack
and fixed locations (representing local or global variables).

<p> The main portion of the interpreter is implemented in the eval_code2
function in <code><a
href="/~skip/python/Python/dist/src/Python/ceval.c">ceval.c</a></code>.
A large switch statement is used to decode and execute individual
instructions:

<pre>
switch (opcode) {
    case POP_TOP:
        ...
        continue;
            
    case ROT_TWO:
        ...
        continue;
    ...
    case BINARY_MULTIPLY:
        ...
        break;
    ...
}
</pre>

<p> There are several different ways to improve the performance of Python
programs. Some of the most obvious ones are:

<dl>

  <dt> <strong>Optimize the Python code.</strong> <dd> Straightforward
  reorganization of Python code, replacing less efficient algorithms with
  more efficient ones, reimplimenting some critical code in extension
  modules or rearchitecting the application altogether can have dramatic
  effects on the program's performance.  In this regard Python is no
  different than most other programming languages.

  <dt> <strong>Improve the efficiency of the interpreter itself.</strong>
  <dd> The C code that implements the interpreter has been improved
  dramatically, and it can be made still more efficient. If the interpreter
  can make assumptions about the properties of some objects, some of the
  underlying functions the interpreter relies on can also be improved, or
  replaced altogether with versions that avoid needless error checks and
  thus streamline their execution.

  <dt> <strong>Improve the sequence of instructions executed.</strong> <dd>
  The peephole optimizer described here is one example of this.  It works by
  matching fairly straightforward patterns of instructions and replacing
  them with faster, though equivalent, sequences.  Much more sophisticated
  optimizations are possible as well, as has been demonstrated by Chambers
  for Self&nbsp;[Cham].

  <dt> <strong>Change the architecture of the virtual machine.</strong> <dd>
  Identifying special case instructions, such as integer loads or
  instructions that resolve dotted names (e.g., <code>string.join</code>) in
  one instruction instead of two can improve the performance of the system.
  Changing the underlying architecture - by adding registers to the
  architecture, for instance - can improve performance.  For instance,
  adding registers to the virtual machine and implementing a decent register
  allocation scheme has the potential to reduce data movement within the
  virtual machine significantly.

  <dt> <strong>Replace the interpreter altogether.</strong> <dd> <a
  href="http://www.python.org/jpython/">JPython</a> replaces the Python
  virtual machine with the Java virtual machine.  While this was not done
  necessarily for performance reasons, increased performance may result as
  JVM technology continues to improve.  Python-to-C converters also fall
  into this category.

</dl>

<h2 align=center>Architecture</H2>

<p> The peephole optimizer&nbsp;[Mon1] is organized as a set of Python
classes.  Each class is a subclass of the OptimizeFilter base class,
specialized for applying a single optimization.  An entire optimizer is
built by chaining several optimizers together in a pipeline.  OptimizeFilter
instances accept either a code object or another OptimizeFilter instance as
input, as well as optional lists of local variable names, values, and
constants.  The optimize method breaks up the code into basic blocks, then
calls optimize_block for each basic block, replacing it with the return
value of the call.

<pre>
def optimize(self):
    blocks = self.input
    self.output = [None]*len(blocks)
    for i in range(len(blocks)):
        self.output[i] = self.optimize_block(blocks[i])
</pre>

For the purposes of this work, a basic block is a straight section of code
whose only entry point is the first instruction in the block.  This differs
slight from that used by Aho, et. al.&nbsp;[Aho], who further constrain basic
blocks to have only one exit point.  While the current definition isn't
strictly incorrect, it may not expose as many opportunities for
optimizations as Aho's does.

<p> In most cases, OptimizeFilter subclasses need only implement an
<code>optimize_block</code> method.  One optimizer class
(JumpNextEliminator) overrides the <code>optimize</code> method however,
because it looks across basic block boundaries.

<p> The optimizer is invoked by the byte code compiler if run-time
optimization has been selected with the -O flag and the
<code>optimize</code> module can be located and imported.  An alternative
implementation would be to post-process <code>.pyc</code> files, emitting
<code>.pyo</code> files as a result.  This was not considered because it
would require reliance of the optimizer on the <code>new</code> module to
generate new code objects which is not built into the Python executable by
default.

<p> Chaining individual optimizer instances into a pipeline allows large
optimizers to be constructed easily.  It is easy to plug new optimizer
instances into the pipeline at the appropriate point(s).  The main
optimization function is:

<pre>
def optimize5(code, v=None, n=None, c=None):
    lsc = LoadStoreCompressor(code, v, n, c)
    sle = StoreLoadEliminator(lsc, v, n, c)
    lnr = LineNumberRemover(sle, v, n, c)
    ...
    jne2 = JumpNextEliminator(dcr2, v, n, c)
    jpo2 = JumpOptimizer(jne2, v, n, c)
    return jpo2.code()
</pre>

Note that each optimizer instance except the first takes another optimizer
instance as input.  The first optimizer step, the
<code>LoadStoreCompressor</code> instance, takes the byte code string as
input.

<p> Several new instructions were added to the Python virtual machine. The
<code>LOADI</code> instruction uses the <code>small_ints</code> cache
maintained in <a
href="/~skip/python/Python/dist/src/Objects/intobject.c">intobject.c</a>
to speed up loading of small positive integers.  <code>LOAD_TWO_FAST</code>
and <code>STORE_TWO_FAST</code> encode two arguments to load in their 16-bit
arguments.  <code>LOAD_ATTR_FAST</code> and <code>STORE_ATTR_FAST</code>
encode a local argument reference and an attribute name reference in their
16-bit arguments.

<p> In the paragraphs that follow, each of the optimization classes
currently implemented is described briefly, with examples, where
appropriate, of the specific optimizations they perform.

<h3>TupleRearranger</h3>

<p>
This class optimizes Python code like

<pre>
a,b,c = 1,2,3
</pre>

into the byte code equivalent of

<pre>
c = 3
b = 2
a = 1
</pre>

avoiding the overhead of building and unpacking a tuple.  This is an obvious
pattern likely to appear in Python byte code, but less likely to occur in
languages without similar operations.  The execution order of the right-hand
side of the statement is not affected.  The assignment to the variables on
the left-hand side is optimized, however.  The above assignment statement
generates a sequence of instructions that look like

<pre>
LOAD_CONST   1
LOAD_CONST   2
LOAD_CONST   3
BUILD_TUPLE  3
UNPACK_TUPLE 3
STORE_FAST   a
STORE_FAST   b
STORE_FAST   c
</pre>

<p> The net effect of the <code>BUILD_TUPLE/UNPACK_TUPLE</code> pair is simply
to reverse the order of the three values on the top of the stack.  Instead
of reversing the order of the operands, it's simpler to reverse the order of
the assignments:

<pre>
LOAD_CONST   1
LOAD_CONST   2
LOAD_CONST   3
STORE_FAST   c
STORE_FAST   b
STORE_FAST   a
</pre>

and avoid tuple creation and deletion altogether.

<p> This optimization is not applied in all cases.  If the
<code>UNPACK_TUPLE</code> instruction is not followed immediately by at lest
the same number of simple stores (stores to individual global or local
variables) to unique variables, the optimization is not performed.
Transforming

<pre>
LOAD_CONST   1
LOAD_CONST   2
LOAD_CONST   3
BUILD_TUPLE  3
UNPACK_TUPLE 3
STORE_FAST   a
STORE_FAST   b
STORE_FAST   b
</pre>

into

<pre>
LOAD_CONST   1
LOAD_CONST   2
LOAD_CONST   3
STORE_FAST   b
STORE_FAST   b
STORE_FAST   a
</pre>

is incorrect, because <code>b</code> has the value <code>3</code> after
executing the first sequence, but <code>2</code> after executing the second
sequence.

<h3>ConstantExpressionEvaluator </h3>

<p> This class precomputes a
number of constant expressions and stores them in the function's constants
list, including obvious binary and unary operations and tuples consisting of
just constants.  Of particular note is the fact that complex literals are
not represented by the compiler as constants but as expressions, so 2+3j
appears as

<pre>
LOAD_CONST n (2)
LOAD_CONST m (3j)
BINARY_ADD
</pre>

<p> This class converts those to

<pre>
LOAD_CONST q (2+3j)
</pre>

which can result in a fairly large performance boost for code that uses
complex constants. In general Python code this optimizations is probably not
as useful as in languages like C that make heavy use of macro processors to
define manifest constants.

<h3>UnreachableCodeRemover </h3>

<p> This class deletes all instructions in a basic block that follow an
unconditional transfer.  It does not improve the performance of the program
directly, though by eliminating unused code it can sometimes clear the way
for further optimizations.

<p> <STRONG>LoadStoreCompressor </STRONG>

<p> This class performs two similar optimizations.  It replaces pairs of
<code>LOAD_FAST</code> or <code>STORE_FAST</code> instructions with single
<code>LOAD_TWO_FAST</code> or <code>STORE_TWO_FAST</code> instructions,
respectively.  It also replaces the sequences
<code>LOAD_FAST</code>/<code>LOAD_ATTR</code> or
<code>LOAD_FAST</code>/<code>STORE_ATTR</code> with
<code>LOAD_FAST_ATTR</code> or <code>STORE_FAST_ATTR</code> opcodes,
respectively.  The <code>LOAD_FAST_ATTR</code> and
<code>STORE_FAST_ATTR</code> instructions seem to speed up attribute lookup,
but it's not clear that the <code>LOAD_TWO_FAST</code> and
<code>STORE_TWO_FAST</code> opcodes result in much of a performance
improvement (they do save a trip around the interpreter loop), and they
further complicate downstream optimizations by increasing the number of
different types of load or store instructions that must be considered by
later optimization classes. For this reason this optimizer is currently
executed late in the pipeline.  It should probably be split into two
separate classes.

<h3>MultiLoadEliminator </h3>

This class converts n consecutive loads of the same object to a single load
and n-1 <code>DUP_TOP</code> opcodes.

<h3>StoreLoadEliminator </h3>

<p> This class converts a store to an object then a load of the same object into
a <code>DUP_TOP</code> followed by a store.  This construct occurs
frequently in code that saves an expensive-to-compute quantity then reuses
it:

<pre>
foo = spam = some_hairy_function(...)
bar = foo * math.sin(math.pi/3)
baz = aunt_mabel * foo
</pre>

This class currently eliminates the first load of foo but not the second.

<h3>JumpNextEliminator </h3>

<p> This class eliminates an unconditional jump to the following basic block if
it is the last opcode in its basic block.

<h3>JumpOptimizer </h3>

<p> This class traverses a chain of n jumps, short-circuiting the second through
n-th jumps if they are unconditional.

<h3>ConstantShortcut </h3>

<p> This class converts <code>LOAD_CONST</code> instructions for None or small
positive integers to <code>LOAD_NONE</code> or <code>LOADI</code>
instructions, respectively.  <code>LOAD_NONE</code> short-circuits the
constant lookup of <code>Py_None</code>.  <code>LOADI</code> uses the
<code>small_ints</code> cache in intobject.c to avoid looking up small
positive integer constants.  Both optimizations are useful because they
reduce a series of memory references of the form

<pre>
(PyTupleObject *)(f-&gt;f_code-&gt;co_consts)-&gt;ob_item[i]
</pre>

<p> where f is the current frame, to either <code>small_ints[i]</code> or
<code>Py_None</code>.

<p> Generation of <code>LOADI</code> instructions is a bit fragile, since it
relies on the size of the <code>small_ints</code> cache in intobject.c being
the same when the optimizer is run as when the actual byte codes are
executed later. A more general approach to efficient access of a function's
constants would be to create a <code>fastconstants</code> variable in
<code>eval_code2</code>, similar to the <code>fastlocals</code> variable
already used to speed up access to local variables.

<h3>Branches Not Taken</h3>

<p> At first glance, a number of other code transformations seem possible.
It would be nice to rearrange expressions using the algebraic properties of
numbers, but this can't be done because although an object implements a
particular operation, it's not required to implement the usual semantics
associated with the operation on numbers, and with no side-effects.  For
instance, consider the expression

<pre>
l + a + l
</pre>

This compiles to

<pre>
LOAD l
LOAD a
BINARY_ADD
LOAD l
BINARY_ADD
</pre>

If <code>l</code> and <code>a</code> are numbers the expression can be
rearranged to avoid a load

<pre>
LOAD l
DUP_TOP
BINARY_ADD
LOAD a
BINARY_ADD
</pre>

but not if <code>l</code> and <code>a</code> are strings.

<p> This problem applies to strength reduction as well.  If we know we are
dealing with integers or floating point numbers the following statement

<pre>
a = a ** 2
</pre>

can be sped up by recasting it as

<pre>
a = a * a
</pre>

<p> since multiplication is faster than exponentiation.  The optimizer doesn't
know that <code>a</code> is a number, however.  (There may be some
situations where it can be inferred <code>a</code> is an int or float
object, though this is currently not possible in the general case.)

<p> If the view of the code being optimized is expanded beyond the realm of
basic blocks, other optimizations are possible.  Dead code elimination
identifies variables that are set but not used and eliminates them.  Cross
jumping merges the code common to the tail end of two basic blocks whose
sole successor is the same block.  The following code segments demonstrate
cross jumping:

<pre>
if type(a) == types.ComplexType:
    x = cmath.sin(a)
    foo(x)
else:
    x = math.sin(a)
    foo(x)
</pre>

<pre>
if type(a) == types.ComplexType:
    x = cmath.sin(a)
else:
    x = math.sin(a)
foo(x)
</pre>

<p> Stack pollution (deferred stack cleanup) could be performed if we added a
<code>POP n</code> instruction to the virtual machine.  Stack pollution
saves stack cleanup until it's required.  For instance, the following code

<pre>
f(10)
g(20)
</pre>

compiles to

<pre>
LOADI 10
LOAD f
CALL_FUNCTION 1
POP_TOP
LOADI 20
LOAD g
CALL_FUNCTION 1
POP_TOP
</pre>

The first <code>POP</code> could be deferred:

<pre>
LOADI 10
LOAD f
CALL_FUNCTION 1
LOADI 20
LOAD g
CALL_FUNCTION 1
POP 2
</pre>

<p> This requires analysis to determine that elements on the stack below the
return value of <code>f(10)</code> are not needed before the call to
<code>g(20)</code> returns.

<H2 align=center>Results </H2>

<p> All performance tests were run on a machine with the following configuration:

<pre>
100MHz Pentium, 64MB main memory
RedHat Linux 5.0
EGCS 1.0.3 compiler
Python 1.5.1
pybench 0.6
</pre>

<p> Python was configured using "--with-threads".  The interpreter was
compiled using the -O2 flag of EGCS.  While this does not represent the
maximum optimization possible, it is perhaps the most common optimization
level used.  The benchmark was run four times, twice with the peephole
optimizer disabled, and twice with it enabled.  Between pairs of runs all
.pyo and .pyc files were deleted.  Only the results of the second run of
each pair were used to minimize the effect of executing the optimizer (which
is itself rather slow) on the benchmark results.  Python was run with the -S
and -O flags and the PYTHONPATH and PYTHONSTARTUP environment variables were
not set.

<p> Table 1 shows the results of the benchmark tests. The numbers represent
the per cent reduction (negative values) or increase (positive values) in
execution time for the optimized versus unoptimized runs.

<p> The most obvious result is that there are a few tests that show very
large improvements, a few that show moderate improvements, but none that
apparently suffer much from the changes.  Why this might be the case is
discussed in the discussion below.

<H2 align=center>Discussion </H2>

<h3>Interpreting the Benchmark Results</h3>

<p> This work shows that under the right circumstances, peephole
optimization can yield significant performance gains.  Measuring those gains
is currently rather difficult, however, partly because they are generally
small, but also because the tools available to measure them are either crude
(simple timings), they aren't yet well characterized (pybench) or they
demonstrate an unrealistic mix of operations that makes extrapolation to
real programs difficult (pystone and pybench).  In addition, differences
between compilers, optimization levels and the processors they target can
mask improvements.  The range of optimizations applied here is limited to
patterns the author saw while scanning byte code or those suggested by
others.  It is likely that over time more optimizations will be suggested
and that some of the current optimizations will be improved.

<p> Tim Peters cautions against too great a reliance on measurements of
individual optimizations&nbsp;[Pete]:

<blockquote>

<p> A good change should be made even if timing shows it slowing down on some
combo; if the operation count has been reduced, the timing result is a fluke
due to bad compiler or load-map luck that's probably specific to every
detail of the combo in use, and that will go away by magic anyway.

</blockquote>

<p> This advice is particularly germane if the optimization has not been tested
on multiple architectures, it is still in an early stage of development or
the tools used to measure the change are not yet well understood.
Performance will be affected by many factors, including processor
architecture, the compiler, optimization level and cache size.  It's best to
make a full range of measurements before deciding whether or not to use the
output of the optimizer.

<p> Pybench contains a series of tests which each try to exercise a single
operation.  It is useful as an objective gauge for measuring changes to the
Python interpreter where the byte code generated by the compiler is not
modified and suggesting the general direction of those changes, however it
must be understood that the code in the tests doesn't resemble typical code.
Since the same operation is executed repeatedly, the peephole optimizer will
tend to show no effect (when it couldn't improve the particular operation
being tested) or a very dramatic positive effect (when it was able to
optimize a particular sequence). As an example, consider the
SpecialClassAttribute test in Lookups.py.  It repeatedly executes statements
like:

<pre>
c.__a = 2
x = c.__a
</pre>

<p> where c is a class defined in the local scope and x is a local variable.
The peephole optimizer make significant improvements in the code generated
for these statements.  First, constants will be loaded using the more
efficient <code>LOADI</code> instruction instead of <code>LOAD_CONST</code>.
Second, attribute stores and loads will be performed by either
<code>STORE_FAST_ATTR</code> or <code>LOAD_FAST_ATTR</code>.  Assignment to
c.__a looks like

<pre>
LOADI               2
STORE_ATTR_FAST     c, _SpecialClassAttribute__a
</pre>

while assignment to x looks like

<pre>
LOAD_ATTR_FAST      c, _SpecialClassAttribute__a
STORE_FAST          x
</pre>

Contrast this with the unoptimized code

<pre>
LOAD_CONST          3
LOAD_FAST           c
STORE_ATTR          _SpecialClassAttribute__b
</pre>

and

<pre>
LOAD_FAST           c
LOAD_ATTR           _SpecialClassAttribute__c
STORE_FAST          x
</pre>

<p> Only two-thirds as many instructions are executed per assignment, so
even if they are individually no more efficient, the code speeds up
significantly.  The SimpleComplexArithmetic test falls prey to the same
magnified result, but for a different reason. Complex constants are not
stored as constants in the unoptimized case, but as a pair of loads followed
by an add or a subtract. The optimizer precomputes these constant
expressions and saves the constants for later reuse.  While both tests
demonstrate the positive effect of one or more of the optimizations, their
magnitude has little direct bearing on what one could expect if the
optimizer was applied to production code.  Also, Python code optimizers
improve they will probably progress to the point where much of the repeated
code in pybench's tests is deleted, making them much less useful as tests of
either the optimizer or improvements to the Python virtual machine.

<p> Pybench might or might not test most commonly occurring operations, or
may test them out of context.  If so, the optimizer won't get the
opportunity to strut its stuff.  For instance, it doesn't currently test the
TupleRearranger optimization at all

<p> The only test that seemed to run significantly slower was the
Recursion test.  It's not clear why that was the case.  The optimizer made
only a couple transformations to the recursive function that traded a couple
<code>LOAD_CONST</code>s for <code>LOADI</code>s and removed some
unreachable code.  Studying the C code that implements
<code>LOAD_CONST</code> and <code>LOADI</code>, it's difficult to see how
the former would be faster than the latter.  Executing the following simple
function with and without peephole optimization enabled suggests that
<code>LOADI</code> is much faster than <code>LOAD_CONST</code>.

<pre>
def f():
    import time

    t = time.clock()
    for j in xrange(10000):
	for i in xrange(100):
	    pass
    ohd = time.clock()-t

    t = time.clock()
    for j in xrange(10000):
	for i in xrange(100):
	    a = 2; a = 2; a = 2; a = 2
    print time.clock()-t-ohd
</pre>

<p> With the optimzer disabled, executing the above function displayed 6.88 on
my 100 MHz Pentium.  With it enabled, it displayed 3.38.  Inspection of the
disassembled byte code showed that the substitution of <code>LOADI</code>
for <code>LOAD_CONST</code> instructions was the only change to the code of
the inner loop.

<p> Over the long-run, a series of benchmarks should be developed that use a
mix of actual Python application code.  A small attempt was made to move in
that direction by adding two benchmarks to pybench (PPrint and Pickler)
which are based on test code in two standard Python modules.  More complex
"real-life" tests should be developed, however.  (Who wants to implement
HSPICE in Python?)

<h3>Optimizer Speed</h3>

<p> The speed of the optimizer itself needs to be improved, probably by
recoding parts of it in C.  In its current state it is a hindrance to
startup of programs with short runtimes or that execute most of their code
in the <code>__main__</code> module whose byte code is never saved to a .pyo
file for later reuse.  In the absence of an actual Python-to-C compiler, it
may be possible to rely on the fairly regular structure of the optimizer
classes to aid in manual conversion.  Perhaps some sort of template matching
"compiler" such as Strout's Python2C&nbsp;[Stro] specially tailored to this
application can be written to automate much of the conversion.  This would
make it easy for people to test new optimizations without resorting to
coding them directly in C, but once they are tested to fairly painlessly
migrate them to C.

<h3>Miscellaneous Improvements</h3>

<p> The technique of speeding up constant loads should be investigated
further.  While this appears to improve performance, it could probably be
generalized to speed up access to all of a function's constants without
relying on coupling between the interpreter and Python's integer object.

<p> In theory, it is possible to generate both conservative and aggressive
code based upon presumed knowledge of object types, though it may be
difficult to realize much of a performance gain from it unless the
aggressive optimizations are fairly significant.  It seems unlikely that it
would yield much better performance than the current inlining of integer
adds and subtracts unless a large block of heavily optimized code could be
selected with a single test.

<h3>Do We Need Type/Protocol Declarations?</h3>

<p> To allow the prospect of efficient module compilation to C or machine
code, at various times people have discussed adding some form of (optional)
static type declarations to Python.  At issue are what the syntax of such
declarations might look like, what needs to be specified and how much type
inference can be done by the compiler without them (which would lessen the
need for static type declarations).  Recently the topic of protocols was
raised in the Python newsgroup.  John Skaller implemented a basic protocol
module&nbsp;[Skal].  The current module may not be sufficient for the needs of
an optimizer without enhancement, however, since it allows one to state what
operations a module implements, but not their semantics.  Also, protocols
are implemented by executing Python code.  It's unclear how their properties
could affect the compiler or optimizer without actually executing the code.

<p> Chambers&nbsp;[Cham] demonstrated that a significant amount of optimization 
can be performed in highly dynamic object-oriented languages.  Many of the
techniques applied to Self should be applicable to Python as well.

<h3>Are We Even Headed in the Right Direction?</h3>

<p> Peephole optimization is better than nothing, but doesn't look like it
will yield major improvements in performance, probably not more than 10-20
per cent.  More sophisticated optimization strategies can be tried, but
while they've been demonstrated in other environments, they are not trivial
to implement.  Python's dynamic typing makes it challenging to infer types
and compile-time, though Chambers&nbsp;[Cham] clearly shows this is possible.

<p> Chambers showed that code generation for multiple cases can be used to
generate code for common, fast cases (and allow function inlining in some
cases) while still preserving the full generality of the language.

<p> Instead of applying effort trying to work with incomplete type
information, it might be worthwhile to look at more radical changes to the
run-time system.  For instance, adding registers to the Python virtual
machine in the form of a set of register variables local to
<code>eval_code2</code> and using well-understood register allocation
schemes might significantly improve the data movement characteristics of the
interpreter for both global and local variables, especially in inner loops.
Suppose the following Python code is executed:

<pre>
from math import sin
for x in range(100):
    plot(x, sin(x))
</pre>

The body of the loop compiles to something like:

<pre>
LOAD_FAST plot
LOAD_FAST x
LOAD_FAST x
LOAD_FAST sin
CALL_FUNCTION 1
CALL_FUNCTION 2
POP_TOP
</pre>

<p> Each <code>LOAD_FAST</code> instruction copies a local variable reference to the stack
from the fastlocals array -- two array accesses and a reference count
increment per local variable on each iteration.  If register variables were
available to store references to x, sin and plot, setup code for the loop
would load them into registers once where they could be accessed directly by
register-oriented instructions, and with much smaller penalties.  Loop
finalization code would copy x back to its slot in the fastlocals array.
Assuming references to sin, x and plot are in <code>R1</code>,
<code>R2</code> and <code>R4</code>, respectively, this yields a loop body
something like

<pre>
CALLR1 R1, R2		; R3 = sin(x)
POPR R3			; pop top of stack into R3
CALLR2 R4, R2, R3	; plot(x, R3)
POP_TOP
</pre>

<p> which would reduce or eliminate much of the movement of data between
variables and the stack.  The tradeoff would be the increased cost of
decoding register arguments.  That might be nothing more than an array index
operation, but wouldn't be free.

<p> Implementation of such a system would require substantial changes to the
Python virtual machine and a reasonably sophisticated optimizer.  The
potential payoff seems significant, however. <code>LOAD</code> and
<code>STORE</code> opcodes are the most frequently executed instructions in
the Python virtual machine.

<p> Another possible approach to consider is run-time native code generation
and optimization.  Kistler&nbsp;[Kist] describes a code generator and
optimizer that targets its efforts as it profiles the running system.
Chambers&nbsp[Cham] also implemented on-the-fly translation to machine code
for Self. Such a system would appear to integrate well with Python, since it
is easy to replace function and method definitions at run-time.  One
attraction of on-the-fly native code generation is that it can be restricted
to just the code that will actually be executed, thus allowing more effort
to be put into optimizing the code that is generated.

<p> Optimization of Python programs is still in its infancy.  Peephole
optimization is probably the easiest way to improve performance, though it
is limited in how much can be achieved.  By adding more techniques common to
modern native code compilers&nbsp;[Cham], it should be possible to continue to
improve the efficiency of Python byte code.  Further out, more radical
changes to the underlying system (which can be thought of as different
implementations of the same architecture) may yield much larger performance
improvements.

<p> Peephole optimization appears to be just the tip of the optimization
iceberg.  In its current state, it appears to improve performance by several 
per cent as suggested by <code>pybench</code> results.  The performance of
the optimizer itself can be a hindrance and suggests reimplementation of
parts of the optimizer itself in C.  More aggressive optimizations, such as
code inlining and customization, and architectural changes to the Python
virtual machine, such as the addition of registers, suggest that there is
plenty of room for further significant improvements in performance of Python
applications.

<h2 align=center>Appendix: Other Changes</h2>

<p> During the course of studying the main Python interpreter function
<code>eval_code2</code>, several simple changes to the Python interpreter
were tried&nbsp;[Mon2].  They included:

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Optimization of stack access</strong>

  <dd>By minimizing the movement of the stack pointer the number of memory
  references can be reduced, resulting in small performance gains for
  opcodes that make heavy use of the stack such as <code>DUP_TOP</code>,
  <code>ROT_TWO</code> and <code>ROT_THREE</code>.

<p>
  <dt><strong>Caching the top element of the stack in a register</strong>

  <dd>This improves the memory access patterns of the interpreter a bit more.

<p>
  <dt><strong>Short-circuiting interpreter error checks</strong>

  <dd>The error checking code at the bottom of the interpreter loop tests
  the values of three variables: <code>err</code>, <code>x</code> and
  <code>why</code>.  With few exceptions, each virtual machine instruction
  sets at most one of those variables, so it's almost always faster to check
  for the one error condition an instruction can set directly the code that
  implements that instruction, avoiding the general set of checks at the
  bottom of the loop.  This improvement was begun in Python 1.5, but was
  still incomplete as of the release of 1.5.1.

</dl>

<p> These optimizations yielded moderate performance improvements for some
pybench tests, but also degraded performance in other tests.  Further work
is needed to identify and correct those problems, but these changes show
promise.
