        <h3><font size="2" class="mediumheading">Trek's Burke: &quot;How I did
          it&quot;</font></h3>
        <p><font size="3"><b>An article on Reuters.com By Leigh Buchanan, Inc.com,
          August 2006,</b></font><br>
          (Our thanks to Reuters.com for permission to reproduce this article.)</p>
        <p><font size="2">The first Trek bikes, manufactured 30 years ago in a
          barn in Waterloo, Wisconsin, were cult items, appealing to purists who
          would no more ride their fathers' Schwinns than drive their fathers'
          Oldsmobiles. But Trek had no brand strategy or money to advertise, and
          in the early years it wobbled badly. Richard Burke turned things around
          by positioning the company to ride the rising interest in competitive
          cycling. Today Trek -- still in Waterloo, now employing 1,727 people
          worldwide and producing annual revenue of $600 million -- is the largest
          bicycle company in the United States and the second largest in the world.
          The company is famous for its carbon fiber frames and really, really
          famous for making the bikes Lance Armstrong pedaled to seven victories
          in the Tour de France. Burke, 71, is chairman of the board and Trek's
          majority shareholder. His son John became CEO in 1998:</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Here, Burke reveals how he built the bicycle giant:</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">I was marginal in college. I had a 2.0 average at Marquette
          University. They barely graduated me. But in 1956, the economy was booming.
          Everyone had his pick of offers. I entered a training program in Caterpillar's
          finance department. After 18 months I knew that large corporations were
          not for me and I was not for them. Just before they fired me, I quit.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">I answered an ad in The Wall Street Journal for credit
          manager at a small paint company in Madison. I lasted about 18 months.
          Just before they fired me, I quit.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">I took a job as credit manager of an appliance distribution
          company in Milwaukee, Roth Distributing. I was there a month when the
          president and sole owner dropped dead of a heart attack. I figured I
          was out of a job again. But some of the managers decided to try to reorganize
          the company. I understood finance so I became treasurer and a shareholder.
          If you go back in Trek's history, its original corporate charter was
          that company's.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">In 1973 two things happened: the oil embargo and the
          first physical fitness craze. That caused an enormous increase in bicycle
          sales. As distributors we wondered, should we get into bicycle distribution?
          But we decided that the boom would end and manufacturers would eventually
          sell direct to retailers. So we passed.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Later I met a fellow who had represented a French bicycle
          company in the United States. He had married an American girl and wanted
          to stay here. We decided it might be possible to make bicycles.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">In 1976, management gave me $25,000 to investigate manufacturing
          bicycle frames. At first that's all we made: frames. We opened a small
          factory in a red barn. I was president but low profile. Trek was still
          a division of the distribution business. In fact, it was until 1997.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">At that time Schwinn was dominant in the domestic market.
          But the Japanese were making major inroads, and Schwinn would not allow
          its dealers to handle Japanese product. So we offered the dealers American
          product.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">In 1978 I was a Sloan Fellow at MIT, which I think somewhat
          offsets my miserable academic record. I got to work with Lester Thurow
          and Paul Samuelson.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">We built our first real bike plant in 1980. By 1983
          we were around $20 million. Some years we made money; some years we
          lost money. Everyone looked on it as Dick Burke's Tonka toy.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">In 1984 we made some bad product. Then in '85 we introduced
          the first bonded aluminum frame, but we didn't know how to build it
          in a production environment. We went through a year of building bad
          frames that came back to haunt us.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">I had to make a management change. On a Friday night
          I took out the general manager. On Monday morning I was running a bicycle
          company, and I didn't know a goddamn thing about manufacturing. We did
          a turnaround: fixed the frame and got rid of that bad '84 product. We
          also executed a major growth program. From 1986 to 1996 we took sales
          from about $30 million to more than $300 million.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">We've never been a great strategic planning company.
          I put down a mission statement that's still in place today. It says
          we're going to provide our customers with quality products at competitive
          value and deliver them on time. We are going to create a positive environment
          for our customers and employees. And we are going to make money. That's
          what we did.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">All five children have worked in the business. It's
          a rule: If you're a family member you're entitled to a job. My son John
          graduated from Boston University in 1983. He was offered a marketing
          job at Procter &amp; Gamble, which I told him he should take. Instead
          he took over a Trek sales territory. A couple of years later he became
          customer service manager. He just knew that he wanted to sell bikes.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">We first backed a team in the Tour de France in 1998.
          In 1998 if you asked 10 people on the street they wouldn't have heard
          of the Tour. If you wanted to watch it you couldn't find coverage.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">No one had any idea in 1999 that Lance or the team would
          do so well. When we realized that Lance might prevail I flew over. I
          get there three days before the end. Our VP of marketing is there and
          he says, would you like to ride in the team car? Johann Bruyneel, the
          team manager, is driving. I'm sitting in the front seat with a stopwatch
          and a clipboard to write down intervals. I'm not too good with the stopwatch.
          The mechanic is in the back seat with another set of wheels in case
          Lance goes down. This is my introduction to Lance, sitting in a car
          50 yards behind him listening to Johann talking to him on the radio
          and exhorting him to that performance. The intensity was amazing.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">We have a separate long-term endorsement deal with Lance.
          If it had been up to me we would have never signed him. I'm too cheap.
          I give all the credit to young people like my son and Dick Moran, the
          marketing manager. They said, &quot;This is something we want to be
          a part of.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">I think now that Lance is retired we will just continue
          to push cycling. He's a poster boy for us, but our focus is still technology,
          quality products. We put a lot of emphasis on R&amp;D.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Global sales are 30 percent of revenue, 35 to 40 percent
          of profit. We're losing money in China, but not a lot. Eventually the
          Chinese will have the time and the money to take up cycling seriously.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">About four years ago Trek moved to S status. its been
          good for my family; everyone owns 3 percent to 4 percent. And its been
          good for the ESOP, which holds about 25 percent of the company's stock.
          We tie a lot of direct and indirect compensation to company performance.
          If you're making money you ought to share it.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Family businesses are frustrating. Going from the first
          to the second generation can be clear cut. But the third generation
          isn't far away. I have nine grandchildren. Most people say half of them
          won't want anything to do with the business. So which four or five might
          be interested? And what will it take to run a billion-dollar company,
          which we will be in five to seven years? It isn't a case of which kids
          will have the opportunity. We don't have enough kids for all the opportunities.
