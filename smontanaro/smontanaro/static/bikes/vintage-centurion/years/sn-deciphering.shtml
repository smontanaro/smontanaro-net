  <h1>SN deciphering</h1>
   <p>Below is an excerpt from the Bikeforums in which forum member TMar shows his finding of deciphering Serial numbers for Asian country built bikes. the excerpt below has what pertains to Centurion Bicycles.  If you are fans of other make bikes that were probably built in Asia and are looking for a decipher of the SN please check out the link at the bottom. I am posting the information here for completeness and posterity sake.</p>
   <p>The guide is not necessarily comprehensive, as it only represents what has been collected and decrypted. The level of confidence in the decryption is high, unless otherwise stated. Contract manufactured brands are cross-reference to the manufacturer. The nationality of the brand owner ( pre- 1990) is stated in parentheses. Anybody having any further data, insight or corrections can contact me via the forum's private message process. Hopefully, it is self-explanatory with the use of the following legend:</p>
  <h2>Manufactures and their SN schema:</h2>
   <p>CENTURION (USA) had multiple factories that built the bikes for Centurion they can be: F (1), Katakura, Matsu****a, Mikki, N(1), Tano, U(1).</p>
   <p>F(1): F<u>ymm</u>xxx(xx) Unknown manufacturer. Format seen mainly on 1980s Centurion and Diamond Back, so may be Fairly, a known supplier to Western States Imports.</p>
   <p>KATAKURA (Japan): K<em><u>My</u>xxxxx</em> Format easily confused with Kawamura.</p>
   <p>MATSU****A/NATIONAL (Japan): <em><u>yM</u>xxxxx</em></p>
   <p>MIKI (Japan): <em>M<u>yF</u>xxxx</em></p>
   <p>N(1) (Japan): N<em><u>yF</u>xxxx</em> Manufacturer unknown. Some members believe that the 'N' prefix designates National but given that Panasonic and the Japanese manufactured Schwinns that came from Matsu****a/National do not use this format, it seems unlikely.</p>
   <p>TANO (Japan): not yet decoded</p>
   <p>U(1) (?): U<em><u>ymm</u>xxxxx</em> Manufacturer unknown. These codes start appearing on Centurion and Diamond back models in the very late 1980s. It is known that China Bicycle Company started supplying entry level models to Western State Imports at this time, just before acquiring WSI in late 1989 and this would appear to be the logical manufacturer but bicycles with this S/N format have been reported with Made in Taiwan labels and CBC was located in China.</p>

   <p><em>Y</em> indicates an alpha character designating the year . The year that corresponds to a particular alpha character can vary significantly. The specific convention will be listed under the manufacturer entry. </p>
   <p><em>mm</em> indicates two numeric characters designating the month (i.e 01 = January, 02=February,..... 12= December)</p>
   <p><em>y</em> indicates a numeric character designating the last digit of the year (i.e. 1 = 1971 or 1981, 2 = 1972 or 1982, etc.). With such codes, you have to determine the decade based on frame characteristics, components, etc.</p>
   <p><em>yy</em> indicates two numeric characters designating the last two digits of the year (i.e. 81 = 1981, 82= 1082, etc.)</p>
   <p><em>xxxx</em> indcates a numeric characters designating the sequential frame number within a the fortnight, month or year. This number string is typically four to six characters in length but can vary.The guide is not necessarily comprehensive, as it only represents what has been collected and decrypted.</p>
