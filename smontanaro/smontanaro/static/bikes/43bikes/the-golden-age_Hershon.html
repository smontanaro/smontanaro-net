          <div align="left">
            <p>You hear guys claim they remember “better&nbsp;<br>
            days” in road cycling. There were no better&nbsp;<br>
            days. Today is the best day.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>We never had the choices we have, several&nbsp;<br>
            fine alternatives for every consumer decision,&nbsp;<br>
            whether products or services. We’ve never had&nbsp;<br>
            the convenience we have now.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Examples? Back in the ’70s you could buy a&nbsp;<br>
            titanium frame. You still can. But the worst Ti&nbsp;<br>
            frame you can buy today is worlds better than&nbsp;<br>
            anything you could have bought then. No&nbsp;<br>
            comparison.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>And although the ’70s were the so-called&nbsp;<br>
            heyday of lugged steel frames, you can buy a&nbsp;<br>
            better lugged steel frame now than you could’ve&nbsp;<br>
            then. Frames from many of today’s builders are&nbsp;<br>
            finer, more fussed-over and better finished than&nbsp;<br>
            anything Cinelli, Hetchins, Singer or Confente&nbsp;<br>
            ever produced.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Today you can also buy aluminum or carbon&nbsp;<br>
            fiber frames. You can buy aluminum frames with&nbsp;<br>
            carbon stays. You can buy composite aluminum&nbsp;<br>
            frames that won’t behave the way aluminum&nbsp;<br>
            frames are reputed to behave.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>No doors are closed. If you still believe steel is&nbsp;<br>
            real, buy steel. Buy whatever you want, go for a&nbsp;<br>
            ride, then explain to me why the “old days” were&nbsp;<br>
            superior.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>You say you miss the oneness you used to&nbsp;<br>
            feel with your bike when friction held your bike in&nbsp;<br>
            gear? Buy an old parts group, new in the box.&nbsp;<br>
            Buy used parts. Or buy a 9- or 10-speed group&nbsp;<br>
            or Mavic’s electronic Mektronic shifting. You’ve&nbsp;<br>
            never had so many options.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>In the ’70s, you leaned over a sink and hand-&nbsp;<br>
            washed your wool cycling clothing. That stuff&nbsp;<br>
            took hours to dry, hanging on a line. It shrank&nbsp;<br>
            anyway. Shorts rode up, arm and leg warmers&nbsp;<br>
            fell down. There was no woman-specific&nbsp;<br>
            clothing.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>No bike clothing had style. Style was inauthen-&nbsp;<br>
            tic; no one wanted it. Did Fausto Coppi’s&nbsp;<br>
            clothing have style? Hell no.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Today, all bicycle clothing is easy to wash.&nbsp;<br>
            Almost all of it can be machine dried without&nbsp;<br>
            shortening the life of the garment. You can buy&nbsp;<br>
            jerseys and shorts made to fit women. You can&nbsp;<br>
            buy comfortable, stylish, long-wearing clothing&nbsp;<br>
            at a wide range of price levels.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>If you still want to wear what you wore in the&nbsp;<br>
            ’70s, embroidered wool jerseys with front&nbsp;<br>
            (chicken-leg) pockets, you can do so. Niche&nbsp;<br>
            clothing marketers will cater to your every wooly&nbsp;<br>
            whim.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Seventies shoes were pointy-toed Italian&nbsp;<br>
            things that fit only this one guy in Venice who’d&nbsp;<br>
            already quit riding. Unless you had cheap,&nbsp;<br>
            crummy Detto Pietros or expensive Sidis, you&nbsp;<br>
            paid an impatient shoe repairman to nail cleats&nbsp;<br>
            to your shoe soles, then re-nail them and RE-re-&nbsp;<br>
            nail them, glaring at you all the while.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>There was as much to know about shoes then&nbsp;<br>
            as there is to know about Windows today — but&nbsp;<br>
            no one would pay you to learn it. Knowing it&nbsp;<br>
            didn’t guarantee you foot comfort, either. You&nbsp;<br>
            suffered anyway.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Crummy, inaccurate cyclometers clicked every&nbsp;<br>
            time the front wheel revolved. You couldn’t&nbsp;<br>
            mount some tires onto some rims without brute&nbsp;<br>
            force. Or the tires went on easily, then blew off&nbsp;<br>
            the rims when you parked your bike in direct&nbsp;<br>
            sunlight.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Don’t get me started about saddles. If you&nbsp;<br>
            want a ’70s seat for some perverse reason, you&nbsp;<br>
            can still buy one. Or you can choose from 100s&nbsp;<br>
            of current designs.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>In the old days, we were encouraged to&nbsp;<br>
            dismantle our bikes frequently for maintenance,&nbsp;<br>
            sometimes at ludicrous, compulsive-obsessive&nbsp;<br>
            intervals.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>We used to have to remove inner brake&nbsp;<br>
            cables once a year and smear grease on them&nbsp;<br>
            to keep them from rusting inside the housings.&nbsp;<br>
            Now we have nylon-lined housing and rust-proof&nbsp;<br>
            cables. No fuss.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Back then, you had to maintain top-level parts&nbsp;<br>
            nearly as often as cheap ones. Cheap parts&nbsp;<br>
            were dramatically inferior to today’s cheap&nbsp;<br>
            pieces, some of which work as well and last&nbsp;<br>
            nearly as long as today’s best stuff.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>You can still fuss if you want, dismantling,&nbsp;<br>
            grease-packing and hand-washing, but you&nbsp;<br>
            don’t have to. We’re free at last.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Today you can take organized, professional&nbsp;<br>
            cycling tours all over the world. You can pick&nbsp;<br>
            and choose your tour company; there are&nbsp;<br>
            dozens. You can choose from dozens of cycling&nbsp;<br>
            training camps all over the world: Florida,&nbsp;<br>
            Majorca, Tuscany, Colorado, California...&nbsp;</p>
            <p>You can read hundreds of books about&nbsp;<br>
            cycling. You can watch hundreds of videos. You&nbsp;<br>
            can learn about cycling on-line. You can read&nbsp;<br>
            dozens of cycling periodicals, many of them&nbsp;<br>
            free.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>You can learn more in an hour than you&nbsp;<br>
            could’ve reading 12 issues of Bicycling Maga-&nbsp;<br>
            zine or Bike World in 1978.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Cycling is no longer a cult of true believers&nbsp;<br>
            and freaks. There’s no initiation, no hazing. You&nbsp;<br>
            don’t have to be a mechanic or wear geeky&nbsp;<br>
            clothes. You don’t have to speak French or be&nbsp;<br>
            an expert in the care and preservation of wool&nbsp;<br>
            and leather.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Cycling today does not demand a life&nbsp;<br>
            commitment. It’s fun for nearly everyone.&nbsp;<br>
            I’m not saying everything about road cycling is&nbsp;<br>
            fun. Sharing the road with cars is not fun; not&nbsp;<br>
            often anyway, but it never was.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Dealing with self-absorbed bike shop&nbsp;<br>
            employees is not fun, but you can choose&nbsp;<br>
            among shops or buy mail-order or on-line from&nbsp;<br>
            some pretty cool outfits. You have alternatives.&nbsp;<br>
            In the ’70s, if you were lucky you had one&nbsp;<br>
            good local shop. If they liked you, meaning if&nbsp;<br>
            you passed their mysterious coolness tests, you&nbsp;<br>
            were in. If, for whatever reason, you did not&nbsp;<br>
            pass - you were out in the cold. Not fun.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>It surely wouldn’t have been fun if you were a&nbsp;<br>
            woman, and not a racer. There was no Olympic&nbsp;<br>
            road race for women until 1984, remember.&nbsp;<br>
            Many old school cyclists and coaches failed to&nbsp;<br>
            appreciate females who rode.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Shops today are used to women customers.&nbsp;<br>
            The employees aren’t all adept at helping them&nbsp;<br>
            but at least they aren’t blown away when a&nbsp;<br>
            woman walks into the store...or a guy whose&nbsp;<br>
            legs aren’t shaved or who asks uninformed&nbsp;<br>
            questions.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The retail environment isn’t perfect, but it’s not&nbsp;<br>
            the old boys’ club it was.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Bike clubs are better. The racer/tourist splits in&nbsp;<br>
            many clubs have healed. As the average age of&nbsp;<br>
            club cyclists rises, perhaps fewer are as hard-&nbsp;<br>
            core as they were. Clubs have graded rides and&nbsp;<br>
            clubs-within-clubs.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The ’70s are gone, but you can act as if they&nbsp;<br>
            aren’t. You can wear wool shorts or a leather&nbsp;<br>
            hairnet-style “helmet.” You can hang out with&nbsp;<br>
            guys who know part numbers for Campag pump&nbsp;<br>
            hangers.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>You can learn French and read L’Equipe. You&nbsp;<br>
            can choose clips ‘n straps and spoked, handbuilt&nbsp;<br>
            wheels. You can shift clicklessly and let your&nbsp;<br>
            brake cables wave in the wind.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Unlike the ’70s, you don’t have to if you don’t&nbsp;<br>
            want to.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Most significantly, you can’t go for a ride in the&nbsp;<br>
            ’70s. You CAN go for a ride today. Today’s the&nbsp;<br>
            best day.&nbsp;<br></p>
