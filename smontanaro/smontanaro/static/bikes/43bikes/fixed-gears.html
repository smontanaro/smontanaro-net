          With One Gear, Many Risks;<br>
          A Surgeon Goes Over the Top</i></p>
          <p>By HANNAH KARP<br>
          July 7, 2006</p>
          <p>Forget about 28-speed mountain bikes, cruisers with huge seats
          or $3,500 bicycles that shift gears automatically. Cyclists seeking
          an adrenaline boost on their commute are increasingly climbing onto
          a model straight out of the 19th century: a bike that has just one
          gear, can't coast and often lacks a feature prized by most cyclists
          and law-enforcement officials -- brakes.<br>
          <br>
          Taking a cue from velodrome racers and city bike messengers, a
          growing number of riders are buying so-called fixed-gear bikes.
          Unlike standard 18- or 21-speeds, fixed-gear models have pedals
          chained directly to the rear wheel so that whenever the wheel
          spins, so do the pedals. To stop, the rider has to slow down well
          in advance, or stand on the pedals with enough force to skid to a
          stop. Removing brakes and gears makes the bikes lighter and cheaper
          than feature-packed versions, and purists say they like these
          models -- also known as "fixies" -- for their simplicity and direct
          connection to the pavement.<br>
          <br>
          "Fixie" bikes are becoming more popular.<br>
          While many riders used to build their own stripped-down models --
          and some boutique makers have long sold them for track racing --
          now major bike manufacturers are circling the market. Giant
          introduced its first fixed-gear model for the streets, the $500
          Bowery, earlier this year. Last year, Trek introduced its T-1 track
          bike, a $1,100 model that comes without brakes, while Raleigh
          rolled out its $600 Rush Hour, its first fixed-gear model since
          1980. And Specialized last year sold 5,000 of its fixed-gear
          Langsters, up from 600 when it introduced the line in 2001. Next
          year, Specialized plans to bring out a new version of its
          single-speed bike that transforms into a fixie by simply adding a
          cog.<br>
          <br>
          But for all of their hipster appeal, the bikes can be difficult to
          operate, if not outright dangerous. Because coasting isn't an
          option, stopping takes strength and concentration. A common mistake
          for novices who forget they're on a fixed-gear model is to stop
          pumping -- and go flying over the handlebars as the pedals keep
          spinning, a Specialized representative says. For men, the bikes
          present another challenge: Because riders can't stand up in the
          saddle to coast, long rides can result in reduced blood flow to the
          reproductive organs, which studies suggest may lead to
          impotence.<br>
          <br>
          Chris Dawson noticed fixed-gear bikes all over the street, and
          after checking a few pro-fixie Web sites, the 39-year-old lawyer in
          Sacramento, Calif., bought one earlier this year. "There's a
          perception that fixed-gear riders are these crazy guys," he says.
          "But here I am in my button-down shirt and tie." Now, the father of
          two rides it to work each day -- his is equipped with brakes, and
          he wears a helmet -- and says he loves showing off his new skills.
          That made it all the more embarrassing when he lost his balance
          recently in front of a line of cars at an intersection and toppled
          over.<br>
          <br>
          The danger doesn't stop when the bike does. Fixed-gear owners can
          injure themselves when the bike is elevated on a repair stand. In
          contrast with standard models, with chains that stop spinning if
          something is caught in them, the chains and pedals on fixies keep
          moving as long as the wheel is turning, even if something gets
          stuck in the works. Sites including fixedgeargallery.com,
          cyclelicio.us and Sheldonbrown.com contain tales of stuck digits,
          even pictures of severed fingers.<br>
          <br>
          Fans say they're unfazed. Riders say the bikes provide a killer
          workout because one can set the gear at a low level for added
          resistance. Macho types, meanwhile, revel at riding a bike they can
          stop only with their own brute strength. And experienced riders say
          plenty of rewards come with mastering the bikes -- with bragging
          rights conferred upon those who can execute moves like the "skip
          stop," in which a rider shifts his weight forward to unweight the
          rear wheel, locks his legs to hold the pedals in a horizontal
          position and skids to a stop.<br>
          <br>
          Another move is the "track stand," a technique pioneered on tracks
          and passed down to bike messengers, in which the rider balances in
          one spot by standing on the pedals. Tyler Cannon says he did his
          first track stand to make way for a biker approaching the other way
          on a narrow road. "It really made me feel like the man," says the
          23-year-old from Lake Forest, Calif. His thrill was short-lived. "I
          crashed about 10 feet later when I smacked a pedal on a rock," he
          says. "Luckily, the other person didn't see."<br>
          <br>
          Newer devotees represent a milieu far from the bike-world fringes
          -- including doctors, teachers and Wall Street traders. This
          summer, hundreds of fanatics will descend on Traverse City, Mich.,
          for the second annual Fixed Gear Symposium, organized by a
          60-year-old real-estate broker. Bailey Fidler, a sales associate at
          Boston's Wheelworks bike store, says it used to be unusual to see
          anyone over age 40 shopping for a fixed-gear bike; now, he says,
          about half the bikes go to those in that age range. One popular
          pick: new models such as Cannondale's '07 Capo, which can be
          quickly converted to a single-speed bike that can coast and has
          brakes.<br>
          <br>
          High Margins<br>
          <br>
          While the U.S. bike business is booming overall -- it hit $6
          billion last year, up more than 10% since 2003 -- these bikes
          remain a tiny niche. Of the three million specialty bikes sold this
          year, roughly 15,000 will be fixed-gear models, estimates
          bike-industry analyst Jay Townley of Wisconsin's Jay Townley &amp;
          Associates LLC. While these basic bikes are typically cheaper than
          loaded-down bikes, they're still profitable. Margins on most
          fixed-gear bikes are about five percentage points higher than the
          25% to 30% margins on a typical bike, says Mr. Townley.<br>
          <br>
          In regulatory terms, the bikes fall in a gray area. The U.S.
          Consumer Product Safety Commission says track bicycles are
          "designed and intended for use in a competition." They are exempt
          from federal requirements for standard bicycles, which call for
          bikes to have brakes at least in the rear. Fixed-gear sidewalk
          bikes -- the commission's term for one with a seat height of no
          more than 25 inches adjusted to its highest position, and no free
          wheel -- aren't required to have brakes if they bear a permanent
          label visible from 10 feet displaying the words "No Brakes." The
          same label must be displayed prominently on promotional display
          material and shipping cartons.<br>
          <br>
          The bikes have long been used by racers.<br>
          <br>
          They're illegal in many places. Laws in most states where
          fixed-gear riding is popular -- including New York, California,
          Maryland and Oregon -- require that bicycles be equipped with a
          brake that enables the operator to make the braked wheels skid on
          clean, dry pavement. Still, fixed-gear cyclists and lawyers in
          those states argue, often successfully, that the rider should count
          as the "brake" if he or she is able to achieve the same effect.<br>
          <br>
          To be on the safer side, bike shops generally advise customers to
          add hand brakes to models that come without them, and many riders
          do. Giant, for one, sells its fixed-gear model with brakes in the
          front and back. And in any case, makers say they don't recommend
          the bikes for novice riders, with many marketing their fixed-gear
          models as track bikes. "We think the people buying these bikes are
          savvy enough to know they're meant for one thing and one thing
          only. If a customer seems like they don't understand that, it's up
          to the shop to say, 'Don't go ride it in traffic.' That would be
          suicidal," says Andy Jacques-Maynes, road-bike product manager at
          Specialized.<br>
          <br>
          Ken Heike has a brake on his fixed-gear bike, though he tries to
          avoid using it. He was considering taking the brake off, he says,
          until a recent spill changed his mind. The 53-year-old hand surgeon
          in Oklahoma City, who started riding it to train for a triathlon,
          says he was "booking" through a parking lot recently when a car
          lurched backward. He says he froze, locked his legs -- and "went
          over the top" of the car. He broke his wrist and couldn't operate
          for two weeks, he says. "All my friends said, 'I told you it was
          dangerous.' I do wonder if it would have been a different situation
          on another bike," he says. As for the hand brake, he adds: "I think
          I'm going to keep it."<br>
          <br>
          Bike Spills<br>
          <br>
          There are no statistics on how many bike accidents involve
          fixed-gear cycles, and typically bike spills of all kinds go
          underreported. But overall, bike-accident fatalities are on the
          rise, especially in urban areas. In 2004, 725 cyclists were killed
          in traffic crashes, according to the latest data from the National
          Highway Traffic Safety Administration, up from 629 the previous
          year. Anecdotally, dealers say they see a higher proportion of
          fixed-gear bikes come back to the shop banged up.<br>
          <br>
          The bikes are providing extra work for lawyers. Mark Ginsberg, who
          has represented eight fixed-gear riders this year and serves as
          chairman of the bicycle-advisory committee of Portland, Ore., says
          he's seen the number of traffic citations soar recently, though he
          has yet to see the court hold up a single one. "A fixed-gear is a
          braked bike under the law," he says. "You just must be able to skid
          the wheel on dry, level, clean pavement."<br>
          <br>
          But David White-Lief, a personal-injury lawyer in Boston who
          specializes in bike accidents, says he's relieved that one of his
          current clients had brakes on his fixie -- even though that
          probably didn't help when a car took a left turn and knocked him
          down while he was riding on the side of the road. "It's just harder
          for a lawyer to explain to a jury or insurance company why someone
          didn't have brakes," Mr. White-Lief says.<br>
          <br>
          No brakes? No problem, says Daniel Gonzales. The 29-year-old bike
          messenger in New York, who's fighting his second ticket for riding
          brakeless, says he got the first in November when an officer
          stepped suddenly into the bike lane, raised his arms and ordered
          him to stop. "I thought I had demonstrated the fixed-gear stopped
          quite well," says Mr. Gonzales, who locked his wheel and skidded to
          a halt in front of the officer. "I didn't run into him."</p>

          ONE GEAR, WILL TRAVEL<br>
          Lacking brakes and shifters, 'fixies' keep cyclists intimate with
          their pedals<br></i><br>
          Vanessa Hua,<br>
          September 11, 2006<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          <br>
          Flying down San Francisco's hills on his flashy pink track bike,
          Ben Hawkins rises from the seat a couple of inches, leans forward,
          pulls up with one leg and pushes down with the other.</p>
          <p>He's slowing down the only way he can without brakes, by
          torquing into the back wheel.</p>
          <p>For urbanites in the Bay Area, the trendiest bikes right now are
          also the simplest. With one fixed gear and no cables or brakes,
          they're called fixies.</p>
          <p>Once popular only among bike messengers and hard-core cyclists,
          fixed-gear bikes have a place among the hipster icons of trucker
          hats and Pabst Blue Ribbon beer. Their urban cool is attracting the
          attention of mainstream marketers: Multinational sportswear company
          Puma has created online guides to fixies, and Ford features them in
          Lincoln Navigator ads.</p>
          <p>Much of the appeal lies in the clean aesthetics and the
          challenge the bikes offer, say enthusiasts from San Francisco to
          Los Angeles to New York. Plus there's less to steal or damage.</p>
          <p>Fixies also satisfy a desire to be different -- though on sunny
          afternoons in San Francisco's Mission District or the Lower Haight
          a veritable fleet floods the streets and the sidewalks outside
          cafes and bars.</p>
          <p>Track bikes have a retro appeal because they hark back to the
          turn of the last century, when bike riders couldn't coast because
          their cycles lacked a freewheel (invented in 1897). Fixie riders'
          feet have to keep up with the spinning pedals, going downhill and
          up.</p>
          <p>"I like how it feels where the pedals push you back. You push
          them, and they push you back," said Hawkins, 31, a freelance
          computer animator who lives in the Mission. Bearded and gregarious,
          he wore funky glasses and rolled-up jeans with dark red knee socks
          on a recent ride. "You have no options. It takes more strength to
          ride it. You have to develop the muscles to brake."</p>
          <p>Earlier this year, the longtime cyclist discovered a MySpace
          group devoted to fixies and is now part of a community that races,
          takes long rides into Marin and throws house parties.</p>
          <p>"You can always tell how fast you are going by how fast your
          legs are going. There's something really nice about it," said Judah
          Mendez, 28, an environmental architecture and design student at San
          Francisco State University.</p>
          <p>"There's a connection with bike and the road that is almost
          mystical. Almost Zen-like," said Joe Cosgrove, 45, a Davis
          psychiatrist who began riding a fixed-gear bike two years ago.
          "You're locked into the bicycle. It's almost like the bicycle rides
          you."</p>
          <p>Geared bikes seem to slow down when riders switch gears, fixie
          riders say.</p>
          <p>Cosgrove organized a cross-country fixed-gear ride this summer
          that raised $310,000 to fight histiocytosis, a rare blood disease
          his daughter has. People were generous with donations once they
          recognized the difficulty of the task, he said.</p>
          <p>Fixies are a response to mountain bikes and road bikes loaded
          with gears and gizmos, said Robbin Alfred, a manager at Montano
          Velo in Oakland.</p>
          <p>"Within the last year, we've noticed a huge increase in the
          popularity," Alfred said. "It's a simple machine, with no brakes or
          gears to worry about. You go only as fast as you pedal."</p>
          <p>To get a fixie, riders can spend under $100 converting a geared
          bicycle, stripping away derailleurs and brakes and scrounging
          replacement parts. Or they can drop several thousands dollars on
          imported frames, special equipment and customizations.</p>
          <p>"Instead of hot-rodding a car or buying fancy clothes, they're
          using their bikes to display who they are," said Bradley Wohl,
          owner of American Cyclery in San Francisco, founded in 1941.</p>
          <p>Jenny Oh, 32, of San Francisco, rides a pastel blue fixie with
          bunny stickers on it.</p>
          <p>"It's about the style; it's more unique and distinct than geared
          bikes," said Oh, who began riding two months ago and works in
          documentary film production. She wore checkered slip-on shoes,
          denim shorts and dangly earrings on a recent ride. "I love the
          simplicity. It's very pure, clean and lightweight -- and easy to
          maintain."</p>
          <p>For now, Oh plans to keep a front brake until she becomes a
          better rider. But others aren't waiting. If you've seen a cyclist
          have trouble obeying a stoplight or tumble over to avoid hitting a
          pedestrian, you may have spotted a fixie-newbie.</p>
          <p>"There's a lot of people riding bikes they shouldn't be riding,"
          said Shawn Hatfield, 33, a San Francisco music mastering engineer.
          "They lack the skills. They want the aesthetic of the trend going
          on, but these are dangerous bikes. I've seen a lot of people get
          into sketchy situations."</p>
          <p>Police have ticketed fixie cyclists in Milwaukee and Portland
          for lacking brakes. San Francisco ordinances require all bikes to
          have one braked wheel. That said, San Francisco police Lt. Dominic
          Celaya of the Mission station said he can't recall officers
          ticketing fixie riders there.</p>
          <p>Joel Young, 26, a San Francisco computer programmer, sees brakes
          as a crutch. Without them, he's more attuned to traffic, he said.
          He's had one accident wholly attributable to the bike being a
          fixie: His chain popped off and he used his gloved hand to grab the
          front tire to stop. The tire burned through his glove, but he says
          he didn't crash.</p>
          <p>"It's kind of a vanity thing, if you want to be honest about
          it," he said. "You don't stop for anything."</p>
          <p>Ashley Neese, 26, who does have one brake, admits her knees
          "aren't what they used to be" because of the strain of riding up
          hills without the assistance of gears.</p>
          <p>"This is a bike made to be ridden in a circle, not on the
          street," said Neese, an Upper Market artist trying to lessen the
          sport's domination by men by working on a calendar featuring female
          fixed-gear riders.</p>
          <p>Despite the physical toll, the fixie remains her only bike
          because it's fun and it seems to give her more control than a
          geared bike.</p>
          <p>"It's interesting how mainstream this tiny subculture has
          gotten. I'm questioning how long it can sustain its hipness," Neese
          mused. "But San Francisco is such a big biking city."</p>

          <i class="c4">Hipster bikes don't have a brake and can't get a
          break<br></i> <b>The Oregonian<br></b> July 29, 2006<br>
          By JEFF MAPES<br>
          <i><b><br>
          <br></b> Fact Box:<br>
          What is a fixie? Fixed-gear bicycles have become increasingly
          popular in Portland and many cities with a strong urban biking
          culture, although they still account for a small percentage of bike
          sales. The one-speed bikes do not have a freewheel, meaning that
          the pedals continually rotate while the wheels are in motion.
          Riders can slow the bike by resisting the forward motion of the
          pedals with their legs and stop it by backpedaling. There is no
          coaster brake, as is commonly found on one-speed bikes. Many
          fixed-gear bikes also have a hand brake for the front wheel to help
          in stopping.<br>
          <b><br>
          <br>
          <br></b></i> When Portland bike messenger Ayla Holland wants to
          stop, she depends largely on her powerful leg muscles as she exerts
          backward pressure on the pedals of her fixed-gear bicycle.
          <p>"I actually feel a lot more confident riding a fixed-gear
          because your control over the bike is so much stronger," said
          Holland, 24.</p>
          <p>But a Multnomah County judge has thrown fans of "fixies" for a
          loop by ruling that the Portland police were correct in giving
          Holland a traffic ticket last month for riding downtown without a
          brake.</p>
          <p>In one of the most bike-friendly cities in the country, the
          ruling cast a new legal cloud over the increasing number of
          hard-core bicyclists who are eschewing mechanical brakes for the
          balletic challenge of riding a fixie.</p>
          <p>The bike blogs and Internet discussion groups are full of debate
          about whether the judge's ruling made any sense -- and just how
          safe fixies are without conventional brakes.</p>
          <p>The bikes, once largely restricted to track racing but now
          popular in many cities, have just one speed and the simplest of
          drivetrains. You can't coast. When the wheels are turning, you're
          forced to pedal, just like little kids on a tricycle.</p>
          <p>Fixies aren't for the faint of heart. Jonathan Maus, who writes
          the BikePortland.org blog, admires the skill of the fixie riders
          but has tried one himself just a couple of times.</p>
          <p>"It was really disconcerting," he said. "I was like, 'Holy cow,
          I could get in trouble here.' "</p>
          <p>Oregon law says that bicycles "must be equipped with a brake
          that enables the operator to make the braked wheels skid on dry,
          level, clean pavement."</p>
          <p>Mark Ginsberg, a local attorney and bike activist, argued in
          court Thursday that Holland and other skilled fixie riders meet the
          letter of that law because they have the skill to bring their bikes
          to a skidded stop on dry pavement.</p>
          <p>The law doesn't define what a brake is, he said, only how it
          works.</p>
          <p>Circuit Court Judge Pro Tem Gregg Lowe wasn't impressed by
          that.</p>
          <p>"It seemed to me it was a relatively simple issue," Lowe said
          Friday in an interview. "A rose is a rose is a rose. A brake is a
          brake is a brake. And feet or musculature aren't brakes."</p>
          <p>Ginsberg said he may appeal the decision, which gives the police
          the green light to continue handing out tickets to fixed-gear
          riders who don't have a mechanical brake. In the absence of an
          appeal, Holland has to either pay a $73 fine or install a brake on
          her front wheel.</p>
          <p>In fact, many fixies do have such a brake. One of Holland's
          fellow messengers, watching as Holland was interviewed, said she
          relies on the front brake on her bike because she feels less
          competent in using only her pedals to bring her bike to a stop.</p>
          <p>Sam Adams, the Portland commissioner in charge of the city's
          Office of Transportation, said he has asked the city attorney to
          review the law to see whether Portland police are properly applying
          it.</p>
          <p>As it happens, Adams said his chief of staff, Tom Miller, has
          also been ticketed for not having a brake on his fixie. Adams said
          Miller relented and put a brake on his front wheel -- although he
          demonstrated for the commissioner that he can stop as quickly as a
          conventional bike.</p>
          <p>But Adams said he's still not convinced. "My advice to people is
          to get handbrakes," he said. "I think it's an added margin of
          safety."</p>

          <b><i>Fixed-Gear Bikes an Urban Fixture<br></i> Wired Magazine</b>
          <p>By Ryan Singel<br>
          Apr, 07, 2005</p>
          <p>Jim Wirtanen spent 12 years as a bike messenger dodging buses
          and cabs on the streets of Boston. He earned the name "Deadguy"
          after being hit by a speeding Lincoln Continental on the third week
          of the job. The collision threw him 40 feet across an intersection
          and he hit his head on a light pole.</p>
          <p>Wirtanen recovered, returned to messaging and for the last 6
          years of his career, delivered packages and legal documents using a
          brakeless, single-speed bike known as a track bike.</p>
          <p>Though a bike with no brakes sounds insane to many, Wirtanen
          swears by it.</p>
          <p>"Basically, a track bike is the perfect invention," said
          Wirtanen, who now works as a mechanic at Harris Cyclery. "You can't
          make it any better."</p>
          <p>Wirtanen is far from alone in embracing the most basic bicycle
          technology in an age where major bicycle companies focus on the
          latest in high-tech gear, including full-suspension mountain bikes
          with SUV-strength disc brakes and ultra-lightweight titanium road
          bikes with carbon-fiber everything.</p>
          <p>Long a favorite of fearless bike couriers, the "fixie" is
          growing in popularity among young urban American cyclists, who love
          the bike's pure lines, low price and street cred.</p>
          <p>"Now all the college kids want them because they have had
          courier bags for the last five years and now they want the bike to
          go with it," said Wirtanen.</p>
          <p>The bikes are also popular with racers wanting to work on their
          form, commuters who ride in rain and snow, and, increasingly, with
          those taking up track racing on banked velodromes.</p>
          <p>Some who ride them on the street simply buy production track
          bikes from companies like Bianchi and Fuji Bicycles, while others
          retrofit old steel road bikes into the "fixies" now often seen
          parked outside hip city bars.</p>
          <p>Fixie is short for "fixed gear," meaning the rear wheel and the
          pedals are connected through a single gear anchored to the rear
          wheel.</p>
          <p>Unlike standard road bikes, there is no way to coast, there is
          only one gear and brakes are optional.<br>
          Simply put, when the wheels are moving, the rider's legs are
          moving.</p>
          <p>As with a child's Big Wheel, if you want to stop, you have to
          use your leg muscles to slow the bike.</p>
          <p>Many riders, but not all, add a front brake, but the pure and
          brave (or foolish) of heart scoff at the notion.</p>
          <p>Oddly, when this configuration was first introduced in the late
          19th century, it was known as a "safety bicycle," since it replaced
          the "high wheel," whose enormous front wheel made for an unstable
          ride.</p>
          <p>Though hand brakes and free wheels were invented soon after, the
          fixed gear remained a popular bike for decades, including during
          the early years of the Tour de France.</p>
          <p>One modern-day devotee, a former mechanic at San Francisco's
          Pedal Revolution who goes by the name Moon, compares the simplicity
          of his current fixie to the BMX dirt bike he rode as a
          teenager.</p>
          <p>"Learning how to ride a fixie was like drinking decaf your whole
          life and then suddenly having the real thing," Moon said.</p>
          <p>Learning to slow a bike with your legs and cornering while
          pedaling makes one a better cyclist, according to Wirtanen.<br>
          Though Wirtanen's shop tries to make sure all nonexperts install
          brakes, he waxes poetic about the thrill of a pure track bike.</p>
          <p>"You take the brake off and you can't get any crazier for field
          testing your skill level than playing in traffic on a track bike,"
          Wirtanen said. "If you are an intelligent cyclist, it makes you far
          more aware. Instead of looking a car or two ahead of you, you have
          to look three to four blocks down the road and have to scan left to
          right constantly to look for escape routes."</p>
          <p>"It's a Zen thing. Once you get used to traffic, then you can
          float through the chaos," he said.</p>
          <p>Sam Murphy, a San Francisco-based photographer who has been
          riding her brake-equipped fixie for two years, is surprised at how
          many brakeless fixies she sees parked in San Francisco's bohemian
          Mission district.</p>
          <p>Though she loves the feeling of "total control over everything"
          she has on her fixie, she worries that many are ridden by
          inexperienced female riders whose boyfriends convinced them it was
          cool.</p>
          <p>"The trend is a little scary in some ways, but I'm just glad to
          see more butts on bikes," Murphy said.</p>

          impossible. This bike doesn’t have a shift lever or extra
          sprockets, and the chain is shorter and wider than on traditional
          bikes.</p>
          <p>There are no fenders, and the rear wheels are probably bolted
          onto the frame to deter theft. You slow down by reversing the
          pedals, or skidding, or doing a skip stop. And that’s just the
          beginning of the differences between your run-of-the-mill 10-speed
          and a track bike, or fixed-gear bike — fixie for short — as it is
          also known.</p>
          <p>Many fixed-gear adherents contend that their bikes are the
          ultimate and all others are pretenders. And these fixed-gear
          zealots are a growing presence on the streets of New York.
          Perceived by some as nuisances, or as troublesome, anarchist
          Dumpster-diving punks who happen to ride bikes, they are
          occasionally reviled, but they are also the subject of curiosity
          and interest. Just as die-hard skateboarders 15 years ago stood on
          the cusp of providing a new lifestyle, so the fixed-gear bike
          culture could be the tip of something that nobody can accurately
          predict but something that is huge.</p>
          <p>Riders of fixed-gear bikes are as diverse as bike riders in
          general. Messengers are big fixie aficionados, but more and more
          fixed-gear bikes are being ridden by nonmessengers, most
          conspicuously the kind of younger people to whom the term “hipster”
          applies and who emanate from certain neighborhoods in Brooklyn. You
          see these riders weaving in and out of traffic without stopping,
          balancing on the pedals at a stoplight and in the process
          infuriating pedestrians and drivers alike.</p>
          <p>In Williamsburg and points south of Grand Street, these bikes
          are legion. But they are fast gaining popularity, not just in those
          bastions of trend followers, and not just among 22-year-olds.
          Fixed-gear bikes are being ridden all over New York, by messengers,
          racers, lawyers, accountants and college professors — a diverse and
          not necessarily youthful cross section of the city’s population.
          They’re being ridden by people who work in sandwich shops and don’t
          know or care about gear ratios and bike history, and by people who
          have been racing these bikes for years in places like the Kissena
          Velodrome in Flushing, Queens, with its banked, elliptical track.
          They’re ridden by militant vegans who are virtual encyclopedias of
          arcane bicycle history, by thrill-seeking members of renegade bike
          gangs like Black Label, by shopgirls, street racers, Critical Mass
          riders, your aunt.</p>
          <p>There’s also the phenomenon of city riders returning to
          fixed-gear biking’s roots and getting back to the track, entering
          races like the Cyclehawk Velo City Tour, to be held at the Kissena
          Velodrome on May 6.</p>
          <p>These disparate riders represent a rainbow coalition, a movement
          that’s about bikes as part of a way of life, as an identity.
          Although fixed-gear bikes can be seen as a trendy accessory, they
          also allow a mild form of rebellion against what many of these bike
          riders see as a wasteful and insipid way of life. Fixed-gear riders
          embrace the contrary notion of taking a different route.</p>
          <p>“We own the streets,” the spray-painted stencil reads. Not
          really, but fixed-gear riders are, in a benign way, promoting an
          alternative to accepted norms.</p>
          <p><i>Anarchy in Motion</i><br>
          So what’s the big deal? It’s just a bike, right? On some level,
          yes. Two wheels, a chain, a cog, a seat and handlebars. But in the
          way that one of Marcel Breuer’s vintage Wassily chairs is just a
          chair that costs $10,000, the top fixed-gear bikes are just
          custom-made bikes that cost 10 times as much as a regular
          factory-made bicycle. The pinnacle of two-wheeled transport, they
          are beautiful objects with simple, clean, stripped-down lines that
          make them look fast even when they’re standing still.</p>
          <p>“They’re the prettiest bikes out there,” said Gina Scardino,
          owner of King Kog, a store on Hope Street in Williamsburg that
          sells only fixed-gear bikes. Indeed they are, with a modernist
          blending of form and function and a look that matches what they’re
          made for, which is going really fast on a banked velodrome
          track.</p>
          <p>But the question arises: Especially in this city, isn’t it
          insane to ride a bike that you can’t easily stop? By riding a bike
          that’s meant to be raced around a special track on the chaotic
          streets of New York, aren’t you risking life and limb?</p>
          <p>It doesn’t make sense. But that may be the appeal, and has been
          ever since the bikes appeared on the scene more than a century
          ago.</p>
          <p>Fixed-gear bikes have a rich past. Before the invention of the
          derailleur, the device that made multiple gears a reality,
          fixed-gears were the racing bike. The original Madison Square
          Garden, built in 1879 at 26th Street and Madison Avenue, was built
          for a velodrome. Races testing speed and endurance drew huge
          crowds, with the top riders among the sports stars of their
          day.</p>
          <p>The bike races at Madison Square Garden were all the rage around
          the turn of the last century. A velodrome circuit flourished around
          the country, with the best racers earning $100,000 to $150,000 a
          year at a time when carpenters were lucky to make $5,000. And all
          this was happening on the forerunners of the bikes being ridden
          today.<br>
          Johnny Coast’s Coast Cycles sits at the end of a desolate
          cul-de-sac in the heart of Bushwick, Brooklyn, near the Myrtle
          Avenue stop on the J, M and Z lines. Mr. Coast, a 31-year-old with
          dreadlocks down to the small of his back, is a former squatter and
          current member of Black Label.</p>
          <p>Coast Cycles is not your typical bike store stocked with rows of
          three-speeds and road bikes, along with locks, water bottles and
          other doodads. It is an old-fashioned, one-person workshop where
          chickens wander in from the yard. Here, Mr. Coast builds two or
          three custom-framed bicycles a month, most of them fixed-gears,
          “tailored to suit a body’s dimensions, to an individual’s geometry
          and affording the maximum of comfort, design and style,” as he put
          it in an e-mail message.</p>
          <p>Mr. Coast, who works surrounded by Bridgeport lathes, jigs and
          blueprints, is a believer in fixies as a metaphorical extension of
          a squatters’ lifestyle that connotes, as he puts it, “living a
          certain way, subsisting on recycling, not wasting, finding
          liberation, freedom as a revolutionary act, like in a Hakim Bey
          sense, primitivist, spiritualist anarchism.”</p>
          <p>He laughs at the absurdity of a brand like Mountain Dew
          approaching Black Label with an offer of sponsorship, as he says
          happened last year, and is wary of exploitation of the fixed-gear
          bike culture by corporations that have little to do with biking. “I
          saw what happened to skateboarding and surfing and punk,” Mr. Coast
          said grimly.</p>
          <p><i>Look, Ma, No Brakes<br></i> The dangers of a small world
          getting bigger were vividly illustrated a few months ago when a
          hipster wearing square-frame glasses wandered into King Kog. The
          store, which sells fixed-gear bikes starting around $800 and going
          up to the thousands, also carries Jason Chaste’s Fortynine Sixteen
          clothing line, named for a gear ratio, and high-end parts like
          Sugino cranks, Izumi chains, and Dura-Ace and Ciocc frames.</p>
          <p>“Um, I’m looking for a track bike,” the visitor said.</p>
          <p>“What’s your price range?” Ms. Scardino asked.</p>
          <p>“Three hundred dollars,” the visitor replied.</p>
          <p>“Hmmm, you might want to try Craigslist or eBay,” she suggested
          gently.</p>
          <p>When Ms. Scardino asked the visitor how he planned to use the
          bike, he answered, “I’m just going to be cruising around.”</p>
          <p>You got the sense that this wasn’t the place for him, but also
          that he might come back one day. As he put it when he left: “I like
          your shop. It’s neat.”</p>
          <p>At Bike Kill, an annual racing event sponsored by Black Label
          and held in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, nobody seemed worried
          about the issue of fixed-gear biking becoming too popular;
          everybody was having too much fun.<br>
          Vehicles used in the event, held on a blustery autumn day near the
          Samuel C. Barnes Elementary School, included tall bikes (two frames
          on top of each other with a seat about six feet off the ground),
          bikes with metal rollers as front wheels, tiny bikes and BMX bikes
          (little single-gear bikes used for tricks) and, of course,
          fixed-gear bikes.<br></p>
          <p><i>Stopping on a Prayer<br></i> Mr. Coast was there, along with
          members of Black Label’s Minneapolis and Reno, Nev., chapters and
          members of other biker groups like C.H.U.N.K. 666, which has
          footholds in Brooklyn and Portland, Ore.; the Rat Patrol, from
          Chicago; Dead Baby, from Seattle; and the Skidmarxxx, from Austin,
          Tex. A lot of unwashed dreads, denim, leather and facial tattoos
          were in evidence, along with a carnivalesque assortment of voodoo
          top hats, orange jumpsuits, bunny ears, Mexican wrestling masks and
          a Pee-wee Herman doppelgänger waving from his Schwinn cruiser.</p>
          <p>There were copious drinking, including a contest to see who
          could ride around in a circle while drinking a six-pack fastest,
          and the “Blind Skull” event, in which riders wearing big foam
          skulls over their heads pedaled until they fell over or ran into
          somebody.</p>
          <p>Toward 8 p.m. the drunken tall-bike jousting began, with knights
          of both sexes armed with padded plastic “spears.” The only
          dissonant note occurred when a cassock-wearing interloper on
          Rollerblades with a motor attached was expelled by a Black Label
          member. “Get your motor out of here!” the biker yelled.</p>
          <p>That’s the cardinal rule. No motors. For environmental reasons.
          Or practical ones, recalling the West Indian messengers who
          pioneered urban fixed-gear riding in the 1980s, bringing their
          ingenuity to New York from the islands, where bikes that didn’t
          have much of anything on them to steal were a decided
          advantage.</p>
          <p>But pinning down what constitutes the fixed-gear movement gets
          complicated. After all, what does the insanity of Bike Kill have to
          do with someone like “Fast” Eddie Williams, who runs the
          bicycle-themed Nayako Gallery in Bedford-Stuyvesant, has published
          a book of photographs of messengers and competes in Alley Cat and
          Monster Track street races?</p>
          <p>Mr. Williams’s scene is the messenger scene, in which he has
          been a participant since the early 1980s, when he first encountered
          the West Indian messengers hanging out at Washington Square Park.
          “I saw them riding,” he said. “I liked how they maneuvered, stopped
          at a red light and didn’t step down. And I thought, ‘How do they do
          that?’ ”</p>
          <p>Mr. Williams got a Matsuri, a fast fixed-gear bike, and started
          working as a messenger. Twenty-five years later, he’s still at it,
          looking incredibly fit and younger than his 43 years. “Track bikes
          are not made for street,” he conceded, “and sometimes I need a hope
          and a prayer to stop short.” But he rhapsodized about their charms.
          “It’s like playing chess,” he said. “You think out your moves from
          a block away.”</p>
          <p>John Campo, the salty-tongued director of the racing program at
          the Kissena Velodrome, is another fixie aficionado. As with Mr.
          Williams, the fixed-gear lifestyle seems to be a healthy one; Mr.
          Campo looks at least 15 years younger than his 60. Biking isn’t his
          profession — he’s a jazz musician who has played with Miles Davis,
          among others — but it is undeniably his passion.</p>
          <p>Mr. Campo missed out on the glory days of the Kissena Velodrome,
          but he tells tales about the father of Vinny Vella, the actor who
          plays Jimmy Petrille on “The Sopranos,” racing at Madison Square
          Garden to win enough money to buy a scale for the pushcart he sold
          fish from, then earning enough to open a fish store on Elizabeth
          Street. Mr. Campo remembers all the Polish, German and Italian bike
          clubs, and he remembers Lou Maltese, a member of the Century Road
          Club who held many cycling records, including the 100-mile national
          record in a race from Union City, N.J., to Philadelphia.</p>
          <p><i>‘A Zen Thing’</i><br>
          Far from worrying about fixed-gear bikes getting too popular, Mr.
          Campo yearns for them to return to the their prominence of a
          century ago, and he welcomes street riders to Kissena. “These kids
          are lovely,” he said. “They come; they win, lose or draw; they have
          a great time. This is an American spirit thing, to be free, to do
          what you want to do and express yourself in your own medium, like
          surfing or skating.”</p>
          <p>Surfing and skating are mentioned a lot in relation to
          fixed-gear bikes. Something about these activities prefigures much
          of what is going on today in the bike community. Surfing 50 years
          ago and skating 25 years ago were small, below-the-radar pursuits
          with their own rituals and secret codes and vernacular. Now they’re
          billion-dollar industries, popular the world over. And in the
          opinion of many aficionados, a little bit of soul was lost along
          the way.</p>
          <p>Bicycling is obviously different; there are more bikes than cars
          in the world, and bikes have a longer popular history, not to
          mention the fact that fixed-gear bikes predate “regular” bikes. But
          something about the trajectories of surfing and skating from
          unexamined, semi-underground secret societies to blown-out cheesy
          “sports” could forecast the future of the fixed-gear bike.</p>
          <p>Surfing and skating retained some of their rebelliousness, in
          part because of the varied, unpredictable demographic of who is
          involved: 5-year-olds and 80-year-olds of both sexes, doctors and
          garbage collectors, law-abiding citizens and criminals. That makes
          the skating or surfing “movement” hard to locate exactly, just like
          the amorphous bike movement.</p>
          <p>Johnny Coast. Gina Scardino. Fast Eddie. John Campo. The
          menagerie at Bike Kill. It’s a broad swath. The group also includes
          people like Toni Germanotta, a 42-year-old owner of an art studio
          that serves the apparel industry. “When you’re on a fixed gear,”
          said Ms. Germanotta, who works in the garment district, “it gives
          you a higher skill level. You have to be constantly aware, always
          watching the road. You don’t just ride, and it feels a little
          crazy.”</p>
          <p>And it includes Kyle Fay, a designer for Urban Outfitters who is
          a relatively new convert. “You take the blame if you get hit,” he
          said. “It’s self-reliance, being responsible for yourself. It might
          sound kind of corny, but it’s a Zen thing, being one with the
          bike.”</p>
          <p>And it includes Alex Escamilla, a 23-year-old book artist from
          Fort Greene, Brooklyn.</p>
          <p>“I had a couple of friends who made fun of me for riding one
          because it was trendy,” Ms. Escamilla said. “But the problem with
          looking at bike riding as a trend is that you lose sight of
          everything that is positive about bikes. You know, the renewable
          energy source, exercise, convenience, saving money, saving time,
          community, seeing the city in a whole new way, blah blah blah.”</p>
          <p>Besides, she added: “Track bikes are fun. And they’re
          beautiful.”</p>
