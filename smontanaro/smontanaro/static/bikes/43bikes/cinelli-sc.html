            Welcome if you are just tuning in. Cino Cinelli 19JH-199&amp;*
            was one of the greatest to create bicycles.
            <p>Ironing out a Cinelli timeline is surprisingly difficult -
            maybe it's best to accept that the date of a Cinelli bike or part
            from the 1950s and 60s won't ever be definitive. "Open questions"
            as Cinelli buff Mike Kone called them.</p>
            <p>The serial numbers up until 1981 reveal nothing of the date,
            nor of apparently anything else. And Cinelli often had a big lag
            between introducing something and production of it, plus overlaps
            on the bikes going out the door as old supplies got used up.
            Andrea Cinelli said the type of headbadge (for example) doesn't
            accurately date a bike at all.</p>
            <p>Many of the dates given in published articles have been
            contested on the <a href=
            "http://www.bikelist.org/mailman/listinfo/classicrendezvoushttp://www.bikelist.org/mailman/listinfo/classicrendezvous">
            CR list</a> and elsewhere such as in Gabe Konrad's <a title=

            <p>The 1960-65 period is important because it encompasses the 1a
            stem and aluminum bars, the bivalent hubs, the smaller badge, the
            74mm bb shell going to 70mm and losing the oil ports, losing the
            ears on the lugs, the unicanitor, the cranks, and many other
            projects for hour records and such. The amount of development
            between the <a href="http://velo-retro.com/" target=

        &nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        Cinelli frames have a loyal following with bicycle fans world wide.
        They were produced in small quantities (750 in the best years) till
        the company was sold to A.L. Columbo group in the late 70's. Cinelli
        frames made up until that point where used used mainly for Olympic
        and World Championship teams.<br>
        <br>
        Cino Cinelli was a successful bicycle racer in Italy, winning
        Milan-San Remo in 1943 and. He started using some of the ideas he had
        created in his head during those year s of racing, when he began
        building frames after Word War II. Cinelli thought that frames needed
        to be stiffer and that the geometry was to relaxed on most of the
        models of that era. He created a fork crown that had sloping
        shoulders and internal lugs. This allowed the blades to be shorter
        and created a stiffer fork . Cinelli also redesigned the seat collar,
        bring the seatstays in behind the lug rather that along side it.
        Fausto Coppi was one of the first to use these new features when he
        raced on a Cinelli frame in 1947.<br>
        <br>
        Cinelli also was known for components, his steel stems and bars where
        classic. There where a number of innovations that he brought to
        cycling. The first clipless pedal, the M71 was released in 1971. The
        first aluminum handlebars to be accepted by the pros. The first
        plastic saddle, the Unicantor was designed in 1962 and became the
        model which all of todays saddles are based.<br>
        <br>
        Hub design was an area that Cinelli put his trademark on with the
        introduction of the Bivalent q/r hubs. This design left the freewheel
        behind in the frame, and the wheel could be used in the front or
        rear. The idea was ahead of it's time, and the cost which was about
        twice what a Campagnolo hub would cost.<br>
        <br>
        Cinelli also created the Laser bicycle which was one of the first
        aero “funny” bikes. This model was used to win many national and
        world titles. Ole Ritter used a Cinelli to set the hour record in
        1968. This model had longer cranks and Campagnolo hubs that were 2
        cm. narrower than conventional hubs. This bike ran on special
        tubulars made just for this record attempt. The bike also had a
        special fork with winged shaped blades for lower wind resistance.<br>
        <br>
        In Italy the professional racers have a special attachment to Cino
        Cinelli. The relationship developed between Cino, Gino Bartali and
        Fausto Coppi.&nbsp; Cino was the foundation of the Italian
        Professional Cycling Association for professional riders. The idea
        was to represent the riders interest in the Italian Bicycling
        Federation, as well as the Italian Sports Federation (CONI). Cino was
        the president of the association for 24 years. &nbsp;His book on
        training for cycling remains a classic to this day.<br>
        <br>
        Cinelli serial numbers do not run in sequence.&nbsp; Only in the post
        - 1981 timeframe (corresponding to the sale of the company to A.L.
        Columbo) do the serial numbers indicate the date.&nbsp; Some frames
        may have sat unsold for years in the shop, others may have been built
        by subcontractors.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        The key to dating a Cinelli is the lugs (3 holes or no hole) and the
        bottom bracket oil port.&nbsp; The presence or absence of these
        features will help to establish the manufacturing date of a Cinelli
        frame.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        The BB port disappeared in about 1965.&nbsp; The 3 holes in the lugs
        appeared in about 1968.&nbsp; The Special Corsa ("A" model) is
        distinguished by its sloping fork crown, where the "B" model has a
        conventional flat fork crown.&nbsp; The "C" model is known as the
        "Riviera".&nbsp; There may have been a factory lightweight model,
        featuring a milled BB - 3 such bikes are known.&nbsp; There was also
        a "Laser" aerodynamic / time trial bike offered in limited numbers in
        the mid-80s.<br></span></td>

                  <span class="c2">By the way, the hubs were NOT patented by
                  Cino; they were designed by the father of a racer named
                  Petrosemolo and the Italian National cycling team coach
                  Rimedio. Andrea also confirms that the 1/A stem (made out
                  of solid aluminum) was shown/used at the Rome Olympics in
                  1960, but that an industrial production was not up and
                  running for quite a few years thereafter. He was a bit less
                  sure about the bars but did seem to recall them being
                  concurrent with the stem. He does not remember the 74 mm
                  width BB at all. Lastly for the badges, he said they were
                  used in a rather haphazard way and it is therefore
                  completely impossible to date frames by simply using badge
                  size.</span>

            <p><span class="c2">Among the most sought-after of all vintage
            lightweights. A few heretics claim they are over rated. I say
            take a closer look and get a clue - or buy a Cannondale. Many
            Cinelli frames show exquisite mitering, smooth and even brazing,
            and lots of lug thinning. This is even true for many examples
            from the early 50's! Sure they have deep ugly file marks too -
            but that is only the surface! Add to the equation that many ride
            pretty close to perfection - at least as some would define it.
            Cinelli frames are also a visual feast with Italian style that
            just won't quit. In Japan, appreciation for Cinelli products is
            near cult-like. Over the past several years domestic prices have
            soared for prime examples. A Cinelli is an icon of cycling
            tradition. Sure, a few Cinelli frames have some lapses here and
            there - but don't miss the point. Cinelli frames defined the
            paradigm of a quality racing bike for decades.<br></span></p>
            <p><span class="c2">they are at least as good as many of the
            earlier ones. Apparently either some very good builders from the
            previous period continued on, or work was contracted to outside
            builders of considerable talent. These bikes from this period
            deserve to be classics in their own right. Their geometry is
            upright, yet the ride is comfortable. These are bikes designed
            for the fast short distance riding so common in the United
            States. They, nonetheless, will handle mountain descents with
            ease as well!<br></span></p>
            <p><span class="c2">Sometime around 1983 it all ended. The 26.2
            sleeved seat lug was replaced with a different cast model that
            used a 27.2 post. The familiar 3 hole lugs were gone as well.
            Quality during the following years took a pretty heavy hit as
            well. Many examples didn't even have chrome lugs. By the late
            80's quality improved and chrome lugs returned. It just, however,
            isn't the same.</span></p>

            (Magistroni) steel cranks that finally gave me true running

        winery in its prior life, the entrance opened into a dirt courtyard
        with the office, the former main house, in the center. The factory
        was dark and dingy and didn't look like a place that made world-class
        bicycles and steel handlebars and stems (which had become the choice
        of riders throughout the world). Here, I finally bought my Cinelli
        road bike for all of $80! During the assembly of the bike, Cino,
