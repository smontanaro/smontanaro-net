          <b><i>Opening That Wallet for a Bicycle Built for You</i><br></b>
          By CATHERINE M. ALLCHIN - <b>The New York Times</b><br>
          <p>Published: May 28, 2006<br></p>
          <p>FOR her 40th birthday, Daniele Imperiale-Warner of Brooklyn
          bought herself a bike. An $8,000 bike.<br></p>
          <p>Daniele Imperiale-Warner of Brooklyn says her customized
          bicycle, made by Seven Cycles, was worth every penny of its $8,000
          price, and helps ease her back pain.</p>
          <p>"Some people spend money on watches or cars; this is my big
          passion," she said, explaining that she rides up to 20 hours a week
          and occasionally races competitively.</p>
          <p>Ms. Imperiale-Warner planned to spend about $3,000 on a
          ready-made, or stock, bike until a friend recommended that she
          consider a custom-made model to alleviate the chronic back pain she
          has from riding. Now, with her specially made bike from Seven
          Cycles of Watertown, Mass., she says she can "log 75 miles without
          any pain."</p>
          <p>When ordering her new road bike, she chose the frame and parts
          she wanted. Then the sales technician totaled the price. "I had a
          heart attack," said Ms. Imperiale-Warner, a college professor. "But
          I figured, I'm 40, let's go for broke."</p>
          <p>Over all, bicycle sales are taking off. Last year was the best
          year since the 1970's, with more than two million road bikes sold
          in the United States, according to Steve Madden, editor of
          Bicycling magazine. An aging population is embracing cycling as a
          forgiving sport, Mr. Madden said, and many people have been
          inspired by the success of Lance Armstrong, the seven-time winner
          of the Tour de France.</p>
          <p>Zac Daab, founder of Cascade Bicycle Studio in Seattle, says the
          growing interest in cycling, specifically high-end cycling, allowed
          him to start his business this year, selling built-to-order premium
          bicycles. "I couldn't have done it three years ago," said Mr. Daab,
          who previously helped design customized bikes at Seven Cycles.</p>
          <p>An entry-level off-the-shelf road bike from a specialty bike
          shop may cost $600 to $700. But enthusiasts with ample disposable
          income seek out the latest technology and highest quality — and are
          willing to pay 10 times as much to get it. A customized bike is the
          ne plus ultra of the bicycling world.</p>
          <p>To some, "custom" means simply a choice of components or paint
          color. But to high-end builders and their connoisseur clients, it
          means a bicycle built from the ground up for a specific person's
          body, riding style and preferences.</p>
          <p>A customized bike was once a last resort for people who were too
          tall or too short for ready-made bikes. Today, small independent
          bike builders are "popping up on every street corner," said Don
          Walker, who founded the North American Handmade Bicycle Show two
          years ago. Mr. Walker estimates that there are at least 125
          professional builders in the United States. And larger companies
          like Serotta and Seven Cycles are building their businesses around
          customization.</p>
          <p>"A decade ago, a custom bike was something you waited a year or
          more for from a one-man shop," said Jennifer Miller, one of the
          founding employees of Seven Cycles, which opened in 1997 and can
          generally produce a customized bike in six weeks.</p>
          <p>"People were paying $5,000 or $6,000 for stock bikes," Ms.
          Miller explained. "The opportunity to provide increased customer
          value by offering fully customized bikes at essentially the same
          price was a no-brainer." Today, she said, the average price for a
          customized model is about $8,000.</p>
          <p>"It's the Starbucks phenomenon," she said. "People will pay $3
          or $4 for a cup of coffee if they can get it just the way they want
          it." Seven Cycles' sales have increased 50 percent in the last five
          years, she said, though she would not give specific sales
          numbers.</p>
          <p>Ben Serotta, founder and chief executive of Serotta, based in
          Saratoga Springs, N.Y., also sees persistent growth at the upper
          end of the market. The company says it delivers about 3,000
          made-to-order road and mountain bikes a year, with annual revenue
          growth of 15 to 20 percent in recent years. The company offers an
          entry-level customized model for about $3,500; its highest-end bike
          goes for $20,000.</p>
          <p>Most buyers of high-tech, high-priced bikes are amateur
          cyclists, not racers. Mr. Serotta sees an increased interest among
          the "Type A power set who work hard and play hard."</p>
          <p>Mr. Daab described the typical customer at his Seattle shop this
          way: "She's 40, well-educated, professional and knows exactly what
          she wants."</p>
          <p>Others in the business say that while sales to women are
          increasing, their clientele is still predominantly men. For some, a
          tailor-made bike is a status symbol, like a luxury car or a fine
          watch. "It's the best-in-class concept," Mr. Daab added. One thing
          is certain: they all have enough money to foot the bill.</p>
          <p>In buying a made-to-order bike, a customer first chooses a style
          based on how and where it will be ridden.</p>
          <p>Superstrong, ultralight materials like carbon fiber and titanium
          are used to make frames that might weigh just over two pounds. The
          frame tubing is selected for the rider's weight and riding style —
          for example, if the rider climbs hills standing or seated, or
          pushes on the pedals in a hard gear or spins the pedals in an
          easier one.</p>
          <p>The frame is designed to be compatible with the components the
          customer selects, like aerodynamic handle bars, disk brakes and
          lightweight wheels. Features like fender mounts or extra water
          bottle cages can be added, and corporate graphics or personal
          initials can be applied to the frame.</p>
          <p>Most of the biggest builders of customized bikes work with
          retail stores, which fit customers for the right bike. Such
          builders do not sell directly, online or in catalogs. The
          philosophy, they say, demands skilled personal attention and a
          lengthy fitting process. At the initial interview, the sales worker
          takes measurements — not only for things like shoe size and
          shoulder width but also for hamstring and hip flexibility — and
          asks questions about the client's occupation, past injuries, riding
          style and cycling goals.</p>
          <p>In 1998, Serotta opened its School of Cycling Ergonomics in
          Saratoga Springs, attracting bike retailers from all corners of the
          country and as far away as Australia and South Korea. A three-day
          training program is required before a shop can become a certified
          Serotta dealer.</p>
          <p>"The school is not a profit center," Mr. Serotta said. "We are
          advancing the science of bike fit. What makes the best bike is what
          makes it perfect for you. How do we get that information?" Ms.
          Imperiale-Warner bought her 40th birthday present from Conrad's, a
          high-end shop in Manhattan. It required an initial fitting, a phone
          interview, then two more hourlong fittings. "It was like getting a
          wedding dress," she said. It took six weeks before she picked up
          her titanium and carbon fiber bike.</p>
          <p>"I instantaneously fell in love with it," she said. "It's worth
          every penny."</p>

        <br>
        By ELISABETH BUMILLER<br>
        <b>New York Times</b><br>
        <br>
        May 31, 2004<br>
        <br>
        When George W. Bush fell off his mountain bike and<br>
        banged up his face the week before last, the world took modest note
        of<br>
        the president's new hobby.<br>
        <br>
        What it did not know was that over the past three months the
        57-year-old<br>
        chief executive, sidelined from the fast track with runner's knee,
        has<br>
        become so consumed by mountain biking that he now rides at least an
        hour<br>
        a day on most weekends, and monitors his heart rate with a wrist
        strap<br>
        during workouts. (Mr. Bush reported through his press secretary,
        Scott<br>
        McClellan, that he sometimes gets above a chest-thumping 160 beats
        per<br>
        minute.)<br>
        <br>
        As it happens, a certain 60-year-old Democratic presidential
        candidate<br>
        is a serious biker, too, although Senator John Kerry more often road
        bikes.<br>
        Mr. Kerry sometimes takes his bike on his campaign plane, and during
        days off<br>
        takes two-hour jaunts along the Charles River in Boston.<br>
        <br>
        At first glance, this is nothing more than the story of two
        middle-aged<br>
        jocks cycling themselves away from the advances of time. At
        second<br>
        glance, this is an election year, and the situation is more
        complex.<br>
        <br>
        First, look at the candidates' choice of bikes.<br>
        <br>
        Mr. Bush keeps a Trek Fuel 90 at his Texas ranch, the site of his
        tumble<br>
        on May 22. The Fuel 90, one of the snazzier of Trek's mountain
        bikes,<br>
        retails for more than $1,500. At Camp David, Mr. Bush also rides a
        Trek,<br>
        but picks it out from the fleet of more ordinary $250 models
        available<br>
        to guests.<br>
        <br>
        Mr. Bush's choice of Trek is hardly surprising, given that the
        company<br>
        is one of the world's biggest manufacturers of quality bikes and
        its<br>
        president, John Burke, is a member of the President's Council on<br>
        Physical Fitness. Trek's sponsored athlete is Lance Armstrong,
        the<br>
        five-time Tour de France winner from Austin, Tex., who presented
        his<br>
        friend the president with a Trek bike at the White House in 2001.<br>
        <br>
        It was difficult to determine if Mr. Burke is a Republican, since
        he<br>
        declined repeated requests for an interview. But it could be
        determined<br>
        that Ben Serotta, the maker of John Kerry's road bikes, is
        politically<br>
        compatible with one of his most famous customers.<br>
        <br>
        "I come from a fairly long line of Democrats," Mr. Serotta said in
        a<br>
        telephone interview from the headquarters of Serotta Competition<br>
        Bicycles in Saratoga Springs, N.Y. If Mr. Kerry won the election,
        he<br>
        said, "we certainly would not be disappointed."<br>
        <br>
        Mr. Kerry owns two road bikes from Serotta, a niche manufacturer
        that<br>
        serves a high-end market. The senator has an Ottrott, which retails
        with<br>
        custom-added parts for an average of $8,000, and an older Colorado
        III.<br>
        Mr. Kerry also has mountain bikes for the trails near his home in<br>
        Ketchum, Idaho.<br>
        <br>
        Moving on, let's take a look at Mr. Bush's and Mr. Kerry's bike<br>
        sportsmanship.<br>
        <br>
        When Mr. Bush had his spill, Mr. Kerry's reaction rapidly coursed<br>
        through political cyberspace. According to The Drudge Report, Mr.
        Kerry<br>
        said to reporters in what he believed was an off-the-record remark,
        "Did<br>
        the training wheels fall off?"<br>
        <br>
        The Chicago Sun-Times then reported that Chicago's Democratic
        mayor,<br>
        Richard M. Daley - who ripped the skin off his kneecap in a
        bicycle<br>
        accident a few years ago - had scolded Mr. Kerry for the wisecrack.
        "You<br>
        should not wish ill upon anyone," Mr. Daley said.<br>
        <br>
        The Republican National Committee then seized on Mr. Daley's remarks
        and<br>
        sent them out as an attack e-mail under the headline "They said
        it!"<br>
        <br>
        Mr. Kerry took his own fall from a bike on May 2 after he hit a patch
        of<br>
        sand on a two-lane road in Concord, Mass. Mr. Kerry had no injuries
        and<br>
        Mr. Bush had no reaction, at least none that we know of.<br>
        <br>
        Finally, let's look at bike-riding performance.<br>
        <br>
        Mr. McClellan said that Mr. Bush typically mountain-bikes 15 to 20
        miles<br>
        for an hour or an hour and a half at a time, either at his ranch or
        at<br>
        Camp David. This past Saturday, Mr. Bush also rode the course at
        a<br>
        Secret Service training facility near Beltsville, Md., where he could
        be<br>
        seen at a distance in a group of up to 10 helmeted cyclists, trailed
        by<br>
        a van and an ambulance.<br>
        <br>
        So far that is the only public sighting of the president astride a
        bike,<br>
        making it hard to gauge his proficiency. But the Secret Service
        agents<br>
        who ran with Mr. Bush in his 6:45-mile days are now busily training
        on<br>
        stationary bikes in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building gym,
        and<br>
        complaining of sore muscles after their intense workouts with Mr.
        Bush.<br>
        <br>
        Mr. Kerry, meanwhile, has covered up to 100 miles a day on his road
        bike<br>
        in some charity rides. "John's a very fit rider for someone 60 years
        of<br>
        age," said Clint Paige, the president of Wheelworks, a company of<br>
        Boston-area bike shops where Mr. Kerry buys his Serottas.<br>
        <br>
        Of course, comparing road biking to mountain biking is like
        comparing<br>
        Democrats to Republicans. "It's a much different type of exercise,"
        said<br>
        Stephen Madden, the editor of Bicycling and Mountain Bike
        magazines.<br>
        "Mountain biking involves a lot of up and down, and it also can
        involve<br>
        a lot of technical expertise in jumping logs and rocks."<br>
        <br>
        Still, maybe as a sideshow to the presidential debates Mr. Bush and
        Mr.<br>
        Kerry should have a bike race, which would add new meaning to
        political<br>
        spin.</td>

          <i class="c9">It's a bicycle built for you<br></i> By Craig Wilson,
          <b>USA TODAY</b><br>
          3/22/2005
          <p>CARRBORO, N.C. — David Holmes is being fitted for a new bike.
          The process will take almost four hours, but it's a small price to
          pay with spring in the air and all.<br>
          <br>
          Sen. John Kerry had two Serottas custom-fitted to his lanky
          frame.<br>
          <br>
          The real price he'll pay will be a bit higher. About $6,000, give
          or take a few hundred. Holmes, 40, a software engineer, isn't being
          fitted for any bike. It's a Serotta, the "it" road bike of the
          moment.</p>
          <p>Named 2004's bicycle of the year by Bicycling magazine, the
          Serotta is where cyclists in the know are resting their fannies
          these days.</p>
          <p>Robin Williams has one. Sen. John Kerry owns Serottas, too,
          including an $8,000 custom Ottrott model. (He famously fell off one
          of his outside Boston during the presidential campaign.)</p>
          <p>Add to the list Jessica Seinfeld, Jerry's wife; Revlon's Ron
          Perelman and his actress wife, Ellen Barkin; Susan Dell, wife of
          computer billionaire Michael Dell, and you're riding in a pretty
          fast crowd.</p>
          <p>Why? Two words: Lance Armstrong.</p>
          <p>When Armstrong began winning the Tour de France, he made it cool
          to ride a road bike. Before that, mountain biking was the
          craze.</p>
          <p>And as more people began buying Trek road bikes to imitate
          Armstrong — first the 5900 Superlight, now the Madone — the true
          geeks wanted to be even more elite, buying ultra-expensive models.
          Enter the Serotta, which can cost more than $10,000 fully equipped.
          (Related story: This bike and its price are Scorchers)</p>
          <p>The high-end road bike market begins at about $2,500, with sales
          rising steadily in the past two to three years, says Megan
          Tompkins, editor of Bicycle Retailer and Industry News.</p>
          <p>In 2004, road bike sales accounted for 28% of the market, up
          from 16% in 2002, according to the National Bicycle Dealers
          Association.</p>
          <p>But what many say gives Serotta's bike a leg up, so to speak, is
          personalized fittings, taught at the Serotta School of Cycling
          Ergonomics, where technicians learn the intricacies of melding a
          Serotta bike with its rider.</p>
          <p>The fitting here at Cycling Specifics will touch on every aspect
          of Holmes' life. It's part psychology, part physiology, part
          biography: that he rides 12 miles of back roads to work, that he
          competes in Olympic-style triathlons (best time: 2:33), that he
          needs a lean machine (16 pounds) under his 158-pound, 6-foot frame
          to cut his time.</p>
          <p>"The best bike isn't the best bike unless it's the best bike for
          the person we're building it for," says Ben Serotta, company
          founder and father figure.</p>
          <p>The 40 full-time employees at Serotta's Saratoga Springs, N.Y.,
          headquarters built 3,000 bikes last year, about a dozen a day.
          "It's not the short path to huge success," Serotta concedes. (Trek,
          by comparison, has 1,400 employees and annual sales of $430
          million.) Each Serotta takes up to 40 man-hours to build, more than
          a Mercedes-Benz.</p>
          <p>How do you describe a Serotta?</p>
          <p>"In a word, it's plush," says William Strickland, executive
          editor of Bicycling. "It doesn't beat you up. It's more comfortable
          and it's more fun."</p>
          <p>Chris Crowley, in his book Younger Next Year: A Guide to Living
          Like 50 Until You're 80 and Beyond, credits his Serotta with
          getting him off his duff.</p>
          <p>"My kids bought me one when I turned 50," says Crowley, now 70.
          "It's so damn pretty, it sucked me right out of the door."</p>
          <p>Fitter Lori Hoefer, who begins Holmes' session chatting on a
          brown suede sofa as James Taylor sings in the background, lets
          Holmes talk as if he was on Freud's couch. The conversation ranges
          from arch flexibility (Holmes pedals with his big toes) to how much
          a rider sweats (a titanium frame is best for sweaters).</p>
          <p>The fitting takes Holmes to a stationary bike, to his old bike,
          to a yoga mat, and then a massage table, where arms and legs are
          stretched. A plumb bob is hung from his knee to his shoe to check
          if the knee is too far ahead, while a red laser is used to see how
          Holmes' knees track.</p>
          <p>Finally, the talk gets down to the frame. Hoefer thinks a Legend
          ST would be best for Holmes. The price for frame alone: $3,795.</p>
          <p>Not everyone is being swept away.</p>
          <p>David Herlihy, author of the widely praised Bicycle: The
          History, a definitive look at the bicycle, is amused by all
          this.<br>
          "My favorite remains my 1983 De Rosa, " he says. "I'm frozen in
          time. Like Rip Van Winkle. Clearly some of these fancy materials
          make a difference, but my De Rosa is still very fun to ride."</p>

          <i><b>Would you spend $14,000 for this bike?</b> Techies drive up
          demand for custom models</i><br>
          By Douglas Belkin, <b>Boston Globe</b> &nbsp;|&nbsp;<br>
          April 23, 2006
          <p>Five years ago, back in the Stone Age as far as bicycling is
          concerned, Anthony Laskaris was thrilled when he sold a bike for
          $2,000. It was a cause for celebration.</p>
          <p>Back then, the really fancy bikes were made of aluminum, the
          most expensive set of wheels on the market might approach $800, and
          a $2,000 sale was proof that big money, top-of-the-line bikes had a
          place on the suburban side streets of America.</p>
          <p>That was then. Today, when Laskaris hears the cash register ring
          up a $2,000 sale, he doesn't even raise an eyebrow.</p>
          <p>''That will buy a good intermediate bike for a recreational
          rider," said Laskaris, who has been in the bike business for 22
          years and is now vice president of the Cycle Loft in Burlington.
          ''Now we start to get excited if something sells for $5,000. At
          that point, you're talking about a pretty nice bicycle."</p>
          <p>Call it bike inflation, and if you haven't been in a bike store
          for a few years, steel yourself for some serious sticker shock. A
          $7,000 road bike is no longer an anomaly; $10,000 editions are
          popping up at recreational weekend rides around Greater Boston, and
          area custom builders are taking orders for road bikes that are
          creeping toward $15,000.</p>
          <p>Where will it end? Dealers say the first $20,000 road bike is
          coming soon to a Daddy Warbucks near you.</p>
          <p>''The first time I saw a $10,000 bike was a few years ago," said
          Stephen Madden, the editor of Bicycling magazine, which is based in
          Pennsylvania. ''It kind of blew my mind, but now it's really pretty
          easy to spend $8,000 on a bike. I know that sounds kind of crazy,
          but there are plenty out there."</p>
          <p>There's a slew of factors contributing to this climb. Lighter,
          stronger aerospace materials available to bike makers get better --
          and more expensive -- every year.</p>
          <p>The Lance effect -- Lance Armstrong's seven consecutive Tour de
          France victories -- pushed cycling into the mainstream and gave it
          a whole new status. And the number of aging boomers with bad knees
          who have hung up their running shoes just as they hit their peak
          earning years has injected a critical mass of wealth and popularity
          never before seen in American cycling.</p>
          <p>Around Greater Boston, with its concentration of successful,
          white, male techies -- who are at the core of this trend, according
          to market analysts -- the proliferation of high-tech bikes is
          unusually broad. One result: A nucleus of custom builders and frame
          makers has made this area a mecca for the production of the best
          bikes in the world.</p>
          <p>The economics of a $10,000 bike look like this: A high-end
          custom-built frame runs $5,000 to $6,000. The forks -- the arms
          that connect the handlebars to the wheels -- cost $600.
          Carbon-fiber wheels can run $3,000, and components -- the
          derailleur, handlebars, pedals, and seat -- another $2,000 to
          $3,000. Then toss in a $2,000 custom paint job.</p>
          <p>This trend has been building for a decade but it began a steep
          ascent three or four years ago as demand at the upper echelon grew.
          Every season the high end jacks up a little higher, the bikes get a
          little lighter and the bragging rights a thousand dollars more
          expensive.<br></p>
          <p>''A generation ago these guys were playing golf, but who wants
          to play golf?" Madden said. ''So instead of spending all their
          money on Big Bertha or some fancy driver, they're putting all this
          money in their bikes so they can show up on their Saturday-morning
          ride and one venture capitalist can pull up to an investment banker
          and ask him what he's riding. . . . It's another way for these guys
          to compete."</p>
          <p>Armstrong's seven Tour de France victories between 1999 and 2005
          added jet fuel to the bike boom. In 2000 there were 145,000
          high-end road bikes -- averaging about $1,100 -- sold across the
          country, they made up just 4 percent of the total number of bikes
          sold and accounted for 11 percent of the retail dollars spent,
          according to Jay Townley, a bicycle market analyst in
          Wisconsin.</p>
          <p>Last year, when Armstrong won his seventh tour title and became
          a genuine American icon, the number of these road bikes sold jumped
          to 498,000, accounting for nearly 16 percent of the market share
          and 40 percent of the retail dollars.</p>
          <p>And those numbers do not reflect the highest end of the business
          -- the bikes that go for more than $4,000. Townley estimates that
          market has climbed from about 20,000 to 90,000 over the same
          time.</p>
          <p>Riding that wave are boutique outfits like Independent
          Fabrications, a custom builder in Somerville that sells about 900
          frames a year. Each is built to order, from the length of the tubes
          to the angles at which they're set. The company's top line, the XS,
          sells for $5,500. A custom paint job -- done onsite -- can run
          another $2,500, said Matthew Bracken, the company's president.</p>
          <p>''It's like anything, people want more customization, more
          specialization," said Bracken. ''Americans work hard, they want to
          play hard, they want to pamper themselves, so when they're out
          there riding they know they're on the best bike they can ride."</p>
          <p>Five years ago, to spend more than $5,000 you had to head to a
          custom builder like IF. But as that boutique market share -- and
          its higher profit margins -- have grown, big companies have
          introduced their own exotic lines. Now mass producers like Trek
          offer a series priced between $5,000 to $8,000.</p>
          <p>That competition is pushing the boutiques to sharpen the
          proverbial knife even more, making their custom fit bikes better,
          lighter and more comfortable -- and more expensive, said Jennifer
          Miller, marketing director for Seven, a Watertown custom
          builder.</p>
          <p>Seven sold about 2,700 bikes last year, most in the
          $7,000-$8,000 range with the most expensive topping out at
          $14,000.</p>
          <p>''There is a certain prestige in having the most expensive bike
          out there. The market keeps demanding it," she said.</p>
          <p>So, just what are you buying for that kind of money? Most
          obviously, weight -- or lack of it. As bike frames have evolved
          from steel to titanium to aluminum to carbon fiber, they've gotten
          lighter, stronger, more responsive and more comfortable. In five
          years, the best bikes have dropped from 18 to 15 pounds.</p>
          <p>A set of wheels, which up until a few years ago maxed out around
          $800, are now regularly selling for $3,000 as they have moved from
          steel to carbon fiber. A company in Germany has even begun selling
          a $5,000 set.</p>
          <p>One bike recently sold at the Cycle Loft was a 16-pound,
          30-gear, carbon-fiber and titanium Serotta Ottrott for $8,500 (the
          same bike Senator John Kerry owns several versions of). To
          enthusiasts, it's like a Ferrari.</p>
          <p>Part of the appeal is that these are the bikes the pros ride.
          ''You can't go out and buy Jeff Gordon's car but you can go out and
          buy Lance Armstrong's bike," said Madden. ''People like to be able
          say they're buying the best."</p>
          <p>And then again, some people don't.</p>
          <p>''I think it can get a little ridiculous," said Jack Donohue,
          who is on the board of the Charles River Wheelmen, a local cycling
          group. ''For me, its gone way beyond the point of diminishing
          returns."</p>
          <p>For two decades, Donohue has made his 24-mile round trip commute

          <br>
          <b>The New York Times</b><br>
          <br>
          By STEVE FRIEDMAN<br>
          Published: November 9, 2006<br>
          <p>IN April, two months before turning 39, Stacy Jargowsky decided
          to learn to ride a bicycle. So she spent $9,000 for a
          brushed-silver custom-made bike called a Guru. “If I can only have
          one, I feel like it should be the best,” she said. It was made of
          titanium, which — gearhead chatter about high performance,
          ultralight strength and lifetime durability notwithstanding — is as
          incredibly cool as it sounds. (Try saying “I’m taking my titanium
          Guru out for a spin today.” Don’t you feel better?)<br></p>
          <p>A few months later, Ms. Jargowsky, who works for Flybar, a
          pogo-stick manufacturer, spent $10,000 for another custom-made
          cycle. “They kind of become like pets,” she said. “Once you have
          one, you want to get another.” This time she bought a Cervelo, made
          of carbon fiber. It’s black. Carbon, according to many in the
          gearhead community, is even cooler than titanium.</p>
          <p>That Ms. Jargowsky spent the equivalent of a few years’ tuition
          at a perfectly respectable state university to buy two bikes when
          she barely knew how to ride may strike some people as — let’s be
          honest here — floridly insane. Then again, people who raise their
          eyebrows at titanium Gurus and the men and women who love them like
          pets, it is safe to say, have not been paying attention to what’s
          been happening at the upper end of the cycling market in
          Manhattan.</p>
          <p>“You go to Central Park and there are all these expensive
          custom-made bikes, and they’re not just for the bike geeks
          anymore,” said Noah Budnick, a deputy director at Transportation
          Alternatives, a nonprofit group that lobbies for bicycle-friendly
          laws in New York City. “You have these corporate guys now. I like
          to say that bicycling is the new golf.”</p>
          <p>Nationwide, demand for specially made bikes is higher than ever.
          “Custom bike sales are on the rise, and we’re nowhere near the
          saturation point yet,” said Megan Tompkins, the editor of Bicycle
          Retailer and Industry News, a trade magazine.</p>
          <p>Lance Armstrong’s seven Tour de France victories provide one
          explanation why the road bike has seized back ground it had lost to
          mountain bikes in the ’80s and ’90s.</p>
          <p>Another reason: aging baby boomers with worn-out knees have
          embraced cycling as a low-impact, aerobically demanding alternative
          to cartilage-grinding sports like basketball and tennis. The
          explosive growth of triathlons, whose participants need bicycles
          that will perform at long distances, has created tens of thousands
          more buyers since 2000. Finally — and not to be underestimated,
          especially in Manhattan — rich people like to buy cool things.</p>
          <p>It’s no secret to anyone who has ever endured an encounter with
          a grease-stained, eye-rolling, heavily sighing bicycle shop
          employee that customer service in the industry has historically
          ranged from sullen to supercilious to overtly hateful. (“It’s one
          of the few retail industries where a condition for employment seems
          to be utter contempt for the customer,” said one industry
          executive.)</p>
          <p>Perhaps that’s why many local sellers of custom bikes are
          newcomers to the market and eager to cater to a discriminating
          clientele. In January, JackRabbit, based in Brooklyn, opened a
          store at 42 West 14th Street, near Union Square. It traffics almost
          exclusively in custom bicycles, mostly carbon and titanium. So does
          two-year-old SBR MultiSports, at 203 West 58th Street, where Ms.
          Jargowsky bought her bikes. Signature Cycles opened its
          appointment-only store at 80 West End Avenue in February.</p>
          <p>Although Altheus Cycling and Endurance Center, based in Rye,
          N.Y., closed its Union Square branch this week, Tom Crawford, the
          store’s president, said the company plans to open at least one
          Manhattan outpost in 2007. In mid-April, another store that
          specializes in custom bicycles, Cadence Cycling and Multisport
          Centers in Philadelphia, will open an 11,000-square-foot store at
          174 Hudson Street.</p>
          <p>Customers who buy bikes at any of these shops first undergo an
          interrogation that bears more similarity to an adoption proceeding
          than to a bicycle purchase. What are their hopes for their new
          bicycle? What are their dreams? After the discussion comes the
          hallmark feature of the custom bike experience: the fitting. An
          assessment can last one to five hours, and — depending on the store
          — may involve computerized pedaling analysis, range-of-motion tests
          and individually designed insoles for cycling shoes (all for $200
          to $375).</p>
          <p>The cheapest bike at any of the stores costs about $1,600 (a
          single-speed aluminum road bike), and the most expensive, $23,000
          (a carbon time-trial bike sold at Signature Cycles that comes with
          handmade German wheels at $5,500 a set).</p>
          <p>If traditional bicycle shops are to SBR, Altheus and JackRabbit
          as coach is to first class, then Signature Cycles is a Gulfstream
          jet. “Very, very boutique,” David Jordan, a cycling coach and
          former professional racer, said of Signature Cycles. He said that
          Paul Levine, Signature’s owner, will “offer you a glass of
          Courvoisier while you discuss your cycling habits.”</p>
          <p>At Signature Cycles’ Manhattan store (there is also a branch in
          Central Valley, N.Y.), there is a massage table for range-of-motion
          analysis. There is an espresso machine. There is, at the bar,
          Penfolds Shiraz and Maker’s Mark. Courvoisier, too. There is a
          shower, because the fitting can be strenuous, and, as Grant Salter,
          an employee, said, “Our clients are Wall Street guys, and they
          don’t want to go back to the office after a visit here and close a
          $5 million deal all sweaty and smelly.”</p>
          <p>To cyclists for whom the phrase “close a $5 million deal” has
          approximately the same relevance as “Why not take a weekend jaunt
          to the third moon of Jupiter,” bicycles like the ones sold at
          Signature may represent nothing so much as the glittery and
          degraded signs of a gilded age’s inevitable decline. Don’t tell
          that to custom bike owners, though.</p>
          <p>A year ago, when Manny Vidal came to Signature Cycles, he was 42
          and hadn’t been on a road bike for 20 years, and, at 5 feet 11
          inches, weighed 260 pounds. He would go to the gym once or twice a
          week. He felt tired often.</p>
          <p>Since buying his $10,000 gray titanium-and-carbon Serotta, Mr.
          Vidal, the chief executive of Vidal Partnership, which specializes
          in advertising in the Hispanic market, has lost more than 40
          pounds. He rides at least 5 days a week for 90 minutes.</p>
          <p>Mr. Vidal admits that his Serotta is sometimes more than just
          something he pedals. “Oh, it’s definitely an accessory,” he said.
          “People stop you and comment on the bike. They’ll want to talk
          about it, ask you about it. They’re the same kinds of looks I used
          to get when I drove a Porsche.”</p>
          <p>Ms. Jargowsky, who rides 60 to 70 miles a week, also confesses
          to a special bond with her bikes.</p>
          <p>“The first time I had to check my triathlon bike for my race, I
          really noticed it missing in my home,” said Mr. Jargowsky, who
          finished three triathlons this summer. “I would look out in the
          hallway and it wasn’t there. It was kind of sad.”</p>
          <p>An accessory? Sad? Are these the sentiments of serious cyclists
          or well-heeled fanatics? Is there a difference? Dr. David Levine,
          an orthopedic surgeon at the Hospital for Special Surgery in
          Manhattan, took up cycling three years ago. Now 39, he rides three
          or four laps around Central Park every weekday morning, with a
          group of other doctors from the hospital. They average about 16
          minutes for a 6-mile lap, or 22.5 miles an hour. Dr. Levine (no
          relation to Paul, the Signature Cycles owner) rides a carbon
          Colnago, which he got from an Italian anesthesiologist who, he
          said, “has a nice connection to a bike shop in Como.”</p>
          <p>Yes, he said, riders of high-end bikes notice other high-end
          bikes. Is there wheel envy? “I’m not sure I’d call it that,” he
          said, adding that it’s more a matter of proud owners comparing the
          advantages of their bikes’ technology.</p>
          <p>Dr. Levine bristled slightly when it was suggested that people
          like him may be a little, um, obsessed with what is, after all,
          just a bicycle.</p>
          <p>“You do feel a connection with it,” he said. “But I don’t think
          anyone in our group takes it to a psychotic, unreasonable
          extent.”</p>
          <p>He paused. “But my wife might disagree with that.”</p>

          <b class="c4">It’s all about the bike</b><br>
          <p>Richard Caseby, cycle addict, on his quest for perfection with a
          custom-made £4,000 dream machine<br>
          <br>
          Like all the worst addictions mine began innocently.</p>
          <p>One day I thought I’d try cycling to work.</p>
          <p>But it’s quite a journey from commuting on a beaten-up mountain
          bike to the point where you’re eyeing up a custom-made titanium
          racing machine with a £4,000-plus price tag. Well, that’s the story
          of my addiction. From spliff to crack den in three years flat.</p>
          <p>When the mountain bike was stolen I bought a hybrid that was
          much faster on the five-mile spin to the office. Just when I began
          to enjoy the glow of regular exercise, my pusher moved in.</p>
          <p>Howard, a bean-counter in our finance department, sidled up and
          asked whether I’d ever tried a “proper” road bike. He had one and
          he did epic rides on it.</p>
          <p>He showed a few snaps of himself and his pals hurtling down
          Alpine passes at 60mph. This was the real rush — a stage of the
          Tour de France, just like a pretend pro. Wouldn’t I like to try
          some of that? So I blew £2,000 on an Airborne road bike.</p>
          <p>Of course, you then pedal about 5,000 miles a year to get fit
          enough to do the bike justice, and justify the expense. Then you
          need a goal to focus all the training. That means you sign up for
          one of the continental cyclosportives — a mass race which takes you
          100 miles up and down three or four classic cols. By that point
          you’re truly hooked because the sense of wellbeing in the saddle is
          almost like a meditation.</p>
          <p>It got worse. I started snapping up rusty bike frames from eBay,
          smuggling them into the house like a dirty secret. A classic 1950s
          Cinelli is hidden in the loft begging for a paint job. I even
          logged on to bike forums so I could swap nerdy information with
          other hopeless cases. And then I discovered a company called
          CycleFit and it all went off the scale.</p>
          <p>These people understand. They ride bikes, race them and engineer
          each model for the physical idiosyncrasies of each customer. They
          are the Savile Row of cycling, the final destination for addicts
          like me.<br>
          <br>
          THE FITTING<br>
          The basic double triangle of the bicycle has not changed in 130
          years. Even Jeremy Clarkson — who regards cyclists as no more than
          potential roadkill — can appreciate that this design is the one
          engineers got right first time: their hole in one.</p>
          <p>What CycleFit does is fine tune the riding position until you
          arrive at the sweet spot — the perfect fit that produces the most
          effective and comfortable transfer of power.</p>
          <p>Mark Kirkman, CycleFit’s exercise physiologist, spends two hours
          measuring body symmetry (my right leg turns out to be shorter than
          the left), flexibility (middling for a desk jockey) and cycling
          style (I’m an inelegant masher).<br>
          He looks at the way I stand (abnormally long legs) and measures the
          tilt of my feet — valgus or varus (tilting out or in,
          respectively). All this is based around an interview: do I suffer
          pain in knees, back or hands? What is my training schedule, how far
          do I ride, what are my ambitions? It’s clear I’m very much a type —
          a middle-aged white-collar worker chasing his youth. “You said it,
          not me,” murmurs Mark.</p>
          <p>Many of CycleFit’s customers are City types who train hard for
          continental races like the Etape du Tour and La Marmotte, another
          classic leg-breaker. In terms of a midlife crisis it’s like buying
          a Ferrari and having to supply the engine yourself.</p>
          <p>The sizing is based around the Sizecycle — an infinitely
          adjustable static bike — which reveals any poor posture or
          defective pedalling.</p>
          <p>As I spin, Mark studies the co-ordinates using a goniometer, a
          giant protractor, to measure knee angles, then a plumbline to check
          the position of my knees over the pedal axles. He sorts out the
          saddle position in relation to the pedals before moving on to
          calculate the ideal top-tube length — the horizontal distance from
          the top of the seat tube to the top of the head tube. This will
          affect handling and comfort.</p>
          <p>Are the legs extended to the optimum angle? Is the chest open to
          allow deep breathing on a long climb? He then uses a light beam to
          check the alignment of my legs in action.</p>
          <p>Mark films me on the Sizecycle, plays back the result and then
          invites other technicians to check my cycling position. My knees
          were blushing at all the attention. It was like a once-over by
          Trinny and Tranny.</p>
          <p>If one leg is even minutely shorter than the other it can throw
          the pelvis out of kilter. This is sorted with shims under the shoe
          cleats that also correct variances to foot tilt. By the time I’ve
          been fitted with custom moulded footbeds, my pedalling position is
          confirmed as passing muster.</p>
          <p>All the data are fed into a computer by Phil Cavell, the
          CycleFit boss, and out comes an ideal geometry — the bike I was
          born to ride.<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          THE BIKE<br>
          Ben Serotta bikes are among the classiest in the world. His top of
          the range carbon fibre and titanium model, the Ottrott, will cost
          you £4,150 — for the frame. Throw in forks, wheels and other
          components and you’re looking at the thick end of £7,000. So why so
          much for a double triangle that’s been kicking around for over a
          century? It can take as many as 60 hours to build a Serotta frame,
          from the selection of the double-butted titanium tubes (internally
          thicker towards each end), through welding and finishing.</p>
          <p>The tubes are designed to deliver strength and compliance
          exactly where they are needed — thicker near the cranks where you
          put down the power, for example, with thinner tubes running from
          the rear fork ends to the seat tube, for shock absorption. Each
          tube is handpicked for the individual rider and each dropout for
          the wheels carved from a solid ingot of titanium. This must be one
          of the most over-engineered bikes ever made.</p>
          <p>The carbon forks come in three stiffnesses to suit the rider’s
          weight and multiple angles to match the chosen handling
          characteristics — shorter for a lively ride, longer for more
          relaxed.</p>
          <p>All my data is sent to Saratoga Springs, New York, where the
          chief designer builds my frame — a matt-finish Concours. Five weeks
          later it arrives in London. Since this is a dream bike there is no
          stinting on the rest of the components — full Campagnolo Record
          groupset and Mavic Ksyrium wheels. Total price: £4,300.<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          THE RIDE<br>
          After the final build in Covent Garden brings frame and parts
          together, the bike is put on a static turbo trainer and I’m asked
          to ride it under the watchful eye of the CycleFit gang. The
          handlebars and stem are tweaked and I’m ready to take to the open
          road on a work of art.</p>
          <p>On the first 50-mile loop down to Kent and back up to London I
          could have wept — of all the bikes I’ve ridden this was the One. It
          feels like an extension of the body — just a welcome extra limb. No
          ache or twinge. The bike simply feels like it isn’t there.</p>
          <p>When you put down the power the stiffness comes through and yet
          it feels beautifully compliant on a fast, uneven flat. Eight hours
          in the saddle is a pleasure.</p>
          <p>“We sell dreams,” says Phil Cavell, “but our job is to match
          that dream to a reality — the reality of what you are and how you
          ride.”</p>
          <p>All I need now is a new engine — but that’s what money can’t
          buy. Or maybe I just need fuel injection. So pass the testosterone
          patches, Floyd.<br></p>
