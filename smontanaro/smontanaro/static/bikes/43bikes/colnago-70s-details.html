    <p>1970s <b>Colnago frame details<br></b> a work in progress, from
    <a href=
    "http://search.bikelist.org/getmsg.asp?Filename=classicrendezvous.10511.1264.eml">
    Eric E and others</a> on the <a class="c3" href=
    "http://www.phred.org/mailman/listinfo/classicrendezvous">Classic
    Rendezvous list</a>.</p>
  </div>
  <p><span class="c2"><b>Lugs:</b><br>
  1969: Cutouts in all 3 lugs, all clubs are the same size. Note however that
  one experienced member recalls differently <i>"I've never seen a Super with
  cutouts all the same size. That would be physically impossible anyway,
  based on the sizes of the lug tangs.</i>"<br>
  1970: Cutouts in all 3 lugs, but club in bottom head lug is now larger than
  the other lugs.<br>
  1971: Cutouts in all 3 lugs, but club in bottom head lug is now larger than
  the other lugs.<br>
  1972: 3 lugs cutout, all same size.<br>
  1973: 3 lugs cutout, all same size. There is general consensus on this too
  but note again that an experienced member believes the single cut-out came
  earlier; may have been as early as 1972.<br>
  1974: Cutout in bottom headlug only.<br>
  1975: Cutout in bottom headlug only.<br>
  General comments: the "fluffier/bulbous" club cutouts appear on the earlier
  bikes. The smaller/leaner cutouts began to show up, give or take, sometime
  after 1975.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Fork Crown:</b><br>
  1969: Two holes in each side of crown, crown itself is a sand cast type<br>
  crown. Some may also have Vagner forged crown, two holes in sides.<br>
  1970: First use of investment cast semi-sloping crown, two holes in each
  side.<br>
  1971: IC crown, two holes in each side of crown<br>
  1972: IC crown, two holes in sides and club in top of each side of crown
  for the first time.<br>
  1973: IC crown, club on top of each side of crown.<br>
  1974: IC crown, club in top of each side of crown.<br>
  1975: IC crown, club and "<i>COLNAGO</i>" on top of each side of crown.
  There were numerous contributions supporting this but again, a experienced
  member took the time to write <i>"This is too early for the *Colnago* in
  the crown.</i> <i>I think that came in by 1977 or so. The first generation
  Mexico's had no "Colnago" in the crown, and their first year was
  1975...earliest possible year for the Colnago stamp in the crown would be
  1976, but I'm betting it was later than that.</i><br>
  <br>
  <b>Fork Tangs:</b><br>
  1969: Fork tangs are blank.<br>
  1970: Fork tang can be blank and a wide tang as opposed to the typical
  narrower ones.<br>
  1971: Often blank narrow tangs.<br>
  1972: Narrow tangs with two holes, upper hole larger than lower hole.<br>
  1973: Some narrow tangs with two holes but now usually with club in
  them.<br>
  1974: Tangs with clubs.<br>
  1975: Tangs with clubs<br>
  <br>
  <b>Seat Stay Caps:</b><br>
  Years??: Plain fluted, ??" length<br>
  Years??: Plain fluted, ??" length (I think the length changed)<br>
  Years:??: Fluted with "COLNAGO" cast along the flute length.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Rear Brake Bridge</b>:<br>
  Years??: Round tube w/brazed on washer (facing the brake caliper),
  reinforced at seat stays, for nutted brake bolts.<br>
  Years??: Round with square/cube area that accepts recessed brake bolt, (did
  this have a club in the top?).<br>
  <br>
  <b>Bottom Bracket</b>:<br>
  1969: Circular drilled holes pattern in BB shell.<br>
  1970: Club cutout in BB shell.<br>
  1972: Club cutout in BB shell.<br>
  1973: Club cutout in BB shell.<br>
  1974: Club cutout in BB shell.<br>
  1975: Club cutout in BB shell.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Dropouts:</b><br>
  1974/75: Sometime between '74 &amp; '75 there should be a change from long
  Campag drop-outs to the shorter ones.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Braze-ons:</b><br>
  197? &amp; earlier: none except chain stay derailleur cable stop<br>
  197? - 197?: Above plus over BB cable guides<br>
  197? - 197?: Above plus shift lever mounts<br>
  197? - 197?: Above plus one set DT water bottle mounts<br>
  19?? - 19??: Above plus ST water bottle mounts<br>
  1976/77: Above plus first appearance of two TT brake cable guides (note
  that the "Colnago" cast into the fork crowns definitely happened before the
  addition of TT brake cable braze-ons).<br>
  <br>
  <img src="fortythree/super-web/colnago_logo1.gif" alt="" border="0"><br>
  <b>Decals</b>:<br>
  1968/69: The playing-card-style decals appeared on frames imported to North
  America in 1968 or 1969.<br>
  1969: Playing card graphics.<br>
  1970: Playing card decals?<br>
  1971: Playing card graphics?<br>
  1972: Graphics change, now just Colnago on DT and first appearance of head
  decal just a club with Colnago underneath.<br>
  1973: First appearance of "wreath" decal on seat tube, between the
  bands.<br>
  1975: Another graphics change?<br>
  1977/78: Another graphics change?<br>
  <br>
  <b>Chrome</b>:<br>
  Generally the Colnago crowns are chromed.<br>
  General comments: Sometimes the dropouts are chromed on these early
  bikes.<br>
  This varies. Head-lugs were chromed sometimes also, nearly always on show
  bikes..but not confined to them.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Colors:</b><br>
  some of standard colors known about -<br>
  1972/73: Turquoise/baby blue<br>
  Early/mid 70's: Candy green, candy red, candy blue, Molteni orange, yellow,
  mauve metallic, black, silver, white, pearl white, electric blue,
  salmon-metallic (similar to Cinelli Rose, but lighter), light purple
  metallic.<br>
  General comments: some wrote to advise you could get a Colnago painted
  nearly any color you can imagine.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Known variations:</b><br>
  With Colnago in the earlier years there are a few slight variations
  possible, mainly in the fork tangs. One list member has a '74 with no fork
  tangs at all. He also had a '74 that had a club in the bottom headlug and
  the SEAT lug only, none in top headlug (he suspects a stray leftover cutout
  seat lug). Another member also knows of an original '72 track bike with
  road blades in a Vagner crown and no chrome. Finally two list members
  have/had ~1975 frames where the crowns were painted, not chromed.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Mexico notes:</b><br>
  Early first-generation Mexico's looked just like older Supers, except for
  the thinner tubing.</span></p>

        During the past several years, we have been searching for a top
        quality Italian racing frame of which we would be able to receive a
        readily availible supply. Last Year when Peter Rich was in Italy he
        made numerous inquiries about builders who would be able to supply
        us. We received samples of several different frames. After close
        examination of the frames workmanship, many months of testriding, it
        was decided that the frames built by Ernesto Colnago possessed
        excellent handling qualities and craftmanship. In the past we have
        dealt with other Italian builders and have sometimes waited two years
        to receive frames. We, therefore, made a preliminary order of ten
        frames, and we are happy in receiving the frames soon after placing
        the order.</span>
        <p><span class="c5">Meanwhile, last October two Velo-Sport employees
        were in Europe visiting various frame builders and bicycle
        manufactuers. Ther were most impressed by the shop facilities of Mr.
        Colnago. The shop is located about 20 miles outside of Milan in a new
        building , with six people working, including Mr. Colnago and his
        brother. They produce approximately 80 frames a month. The majority
        of these frames are ridden by Italian amateur and professional
        cyclists. He supplied frames for the 1960 and 1968 Italian Olympic
        team and the professional trade teams, Molteni and SCIC. Some of the
        prominent professional riders who will be riding Colnago frames next
        year are Eddy Merckx, Felice Gimondi, Gianna Motta and Michele
        Dancelli.</span></p>
        <p><span class="c5">Mr. Colnago has been involed in frame building
        and bicycle racing for many years. Each year, he serves as head
        mechanic for a trade team, for the Giro d' Italia and the Tour de
        France. He has also served as chief mechanic for the Italian national
        team in the Olyimpics and world championships. He either builds
        himself or closely supervises the construction of all his frames,
        unlike a number of other quality Italian frames imported into this
        country bearing one persons name, but built by someone
        else.</span></p>
        <p><span class="c5">We are thoroughly impressed with every aspect of
        Mr. Colnago's building ability. Because of this, we are happy to be
        the first importer of his bicycle into the country. At present, we
        have five frames left (two 54cm, 53cm, 56cm and 58cm). In January, we
        will receive twenty all blue completed bicycles, (two of sizes: 50,
        52, 54, 56, 57, 58, 60, 62, and 64cm). In March or April, 100 frames
        are expected in assorted sizes and colors in addition to five track
        frames.</span></p>
        <p><span class="c5">We plan to keep 30 to 40 frames on hand at all
        times. They are selling for $175 ($410 as a complete bicycle) now,
        which is comparable to other bicycles of similar quality.</span></p>
