  Those who are awake live in a state of constant amazement. — The Buddha<br>

  Taisen Deshimaru "The Ring of the Way" 1983<br>
  My master (Kodo Sawaki) used to say that living our lives is like riding a
  bicycle, you have to have practiced. If body and brain are too stiff you
  cannot do it. You cannot keep your balance. To ride a bicycle you have to
  pedal all the time. If you don't pedal you don't go forward, and if you
  lean over too far you fall down. We have to use our brain like a bicycle.
  In this exact instant in that exact way. Each instant is different. Here
  and now changes every instant so our brains must not be one-sided if we
  decide things according to our own mental categories alone. Our brain does
  not develop and cannot act with wisdom.<br>

  As far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain;

  Sometimes I wonder whether the world is being run by smart people who are

  -Benjamin Franklin<br>
  <br>
  "Well, I say 'yes' to this constitution, with all its faults. We need good
  governance for a while, and this constitution will assure us of good
  governance for a number of years." This constitution will fail, as others
  have before it, and that will be due to the corruption of the people, for
  whom in the end only despotism will serve." -- Benjamin Franklin<br>
  <br>
  "The notion that a radical is one who hates his country is naïve and
  usually idiotic. He is, more likely, one who likes his country more than
  the rest of us, and is thus more disturbed than the rest of us when he sees
  it debauched. He is not a bad citizen turning to crime; he is a good
  citizen driven to despair." -- H. L. Mencken<br></p>
  <p>"When the tyrant has disposed of foreign enemies by conquest or treaty,
  and there is nothing more to fear from them, then he is always stirring up
  some war or other, in order that the people may require a leader." --
  Plato<br>
  <br>
  H. L. Mencken: "The most popular man under a democracy is not the most
  democratic man, but the most despotic man. The common folk delight in the
  exaction's of such a man. They like him to boss them. Their natural gait is
  the goosestep."<br>
  <br>
  "Let them protest as much as they want, as long as they pay their

  --Balzac<br>

  things out for himself... Almost inevitably, he comes to the conclusion
  that the government he lives under is dishonest, insane and intolerable."

  -Plato<br>
  <br>
  Abraham Lincoln (disputed):<br>
  I see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me, and causes
  me to tremble for the safety of our country. Corporations have been
  enthroned, an era of corruption will follow, and the money power of the
  country will endeavor to prolong its reign by working upon the prejudices
  of the people, until the wealth is aggregated in a few hands, and the
  republic is destroyed. The Government should create, issue, and circulate
  all the currency, and credits needed to satisfy the spending power of the
  Government, and the buying power of consumers. By the adoption of these
  principals, the taxpayers will be saving immense sums of interest. Money
  will cease to be master, and become the servant of humanity.<br>

  basis for a sound, comprehensive energy policy. -Dick Cheney<br></p>

  "The whole suburban project can be summarized pretty succinctly as the
  greatest misallocation of resources in the history of the world. America

  "To go from a job you don't like to watching on a screen on which others

  "The biggest downside to a war in Iraq is what you could do with that
  money. What does a war in Iraq cost a week? A billion? Maybe a billion a
  day? The budget for the National Cancer Institute is four billion. That has
  to change. It needs to become a priority again." -Lance Armstrong '05<br>

  "Our close cousins the gorillas and orangs and chimps and gibbon apes have
  gotten along fine all this time while eating raw vegetable matter, whereas

  by making thermodynamic whoopee with fossil fuels."<br>

  --Sir John Harrington<br></p>
  <p>Almost all of human behavior and activity is not essentially any
  different from animal behavior. The<br>
  most advanced technologies and craftsmanship bring us at best up to the
  super-chimpanzee level. Actually,<br>
  the gap between say Plato or Nietzsche and the average human is greater
  than the gap between that<br>
  chimpanzee and the average human. The realm of the real spirit, the true
  artist, the saint, the philosopher, is<br>
  rarely achieved. Why so few? Why is world history and evolution not stories
  of progress but rather this<br>
  endless and futile addition of zeroes? -Timothy Leary in 'Waking
  Life'-1<br>

  "Wherever men hold unequal power in society, they will strive to

  "In fact, telling primates (human or otherwise) that their reasoning<br>
  architectures evolved in large part to solve problems of dominance is a<br>

  "... it became clear to me that our present economic system<br>
  was totally unsustainable and self-destructive.<br>
  It seemed little more than a well-organized<br>
  method for converting natural resources<br>
  into garbage."-- Jay Hanson<br>
  <br>
  As far as converting THIS society to solar,<br>
  I think it's literally impossible. Even if political<br>
  and economic barriers are ignored, there are<br>
  not enough natural resources left to rebuild<br>
  the existing infrastructure--to move everyone<br>
  out of existing hot, dry cities (esp. Los Angeles,<br>
  San Diego, Phoenix, Las Vegas, etc.)<br>
  and house them elsewhere in high-density,<br>
  low-energy structures.<br>
  <br>
  America was built on the belief that fossil<br>
  fuel would last forever. It was<br>
  in our genes. We had no choice.--Jay Hanson<br>
  <br>
  - The destruction of the natural world is not the result of<br>
  global capitalism, industrialization, 'Western civilization'<br>
  or any flaw in human institutions. It is a consequence of<br>
  the evolutionary success of an exceptionally rapacious<br>
  primate. Throughout all of history and prehistory, human<br>
  advance has coincided with ecological devastation.<br>
  John Gray, "Straw Dogs"<br>
  <br>
  Providing for one's family as a good husband and father is a water-tight
  excuse for making money hand over fist. Greed may be a sin, exploitation of
  other people might, on the face of it, look rather nasty, but who can blame
  a man for ''doing the best'' for his children??<br>
  -Eva Figes<br>

  "He who joyfully marches in rank and file has already earned my contempt.
  He has been given a large brain by mistake, since for him the spinal cord

  "The spirits will warn you twice, but the third time you stand alone."
  American Indian saying<br>
  <br>
  The forces we must face are formidable, but the only alternative is
  annihilation. Still the man-made system cannot be corrected by any means
  that requires one's will to be forced upon another, for that is the source
  of the problem. If people are to correct themselves and their leaders, the
  gulf between the two must disappear. To accomplish this one can only rely
  on the energy of truth itself. - from Hopi website

  "You cannot solve a problem on the same level that it was created.<br>
  You must rise above it to the next level." --Albert Einstein<br>
  <br>
  Believe nothing because a wise man said it. Believe nothing because it is
  generally held. Believe nothing because it is written. Believe nothing
  because it is said to be divine. Believe nothing because someone else
  believes it. But believe only what you yourself judge to be true.

  <br>
  "Let me tell you about the very rich. They are different from you and<br>
  me. They possess and enjoy early, and it does something to them, makes<br>
  them soft where we are hard, and cynical where we are trustful, in a<br>
  way that, unless you were born rich, it is very difficult to<br>
  understand. They think, deep in their hearts, that they are better<br>
  than we are because we had to discover the compensations and refuges<br>
  of life for ourselves. Even when they enter deep into our world or<br>
  sink below us, they still think that they are better than we are. They<br>
  are different." --F. Scott Fitzgerald<br>
  <br>
  Recollection of the outward events of my life has largely faded or

  comparison. --Carl Jung<br>

  What you know you can't explain, but you feel it. You've felt it your

  "And it seems to me perfectly in the cards that there will be within the

  “The war on terrorism will not be over in our lifetime. It is different
  than the Gulf War was in the sense that it may never end. At least not in
  our lifetime. The way I think of it is, it’s a new normalcy.” -Vice

  "Beware the leader who bangs the drums of war in order to whip the
  citizenry into a patriotic fervor, for patriotism is indeed a double-edged
  sword. It both emboldens the blood, just as it narrows the mind. And when
  the drums of war have reached a fever pitch and the blood boils with hate
  and the mind has closed, the leader will have no need in seizing the rights
  of the citizenry. Rather, the citizenry, infused with fear and blinded by
  patriotism, will offer up all of their rights unto the leader and gladly
  so. How do I know? For this is what I have done. And I am Caesar." (Julius
  Caesar)<br>

  The crisis in the Persian Gulf offers a rare opportunity to move toward an
  historic period of cooperation. Out of these troubled times... a new world
  order can emerge in which the nations of the world, east and west, north
  and south, can prosper and live in harmony.... Today the new world is
  struggling to be born. -- President Bush, sr. in address to Congress

  Hermann Goering, Nazi Leader in 1939 Germany<br>
  Of course the people don't want war...that is understood. But voice or no
  voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders.
  That's easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked, and
  denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and for exposing the country
  to danger. It works the same in any country."<br>
  <br>
  "Defense is the only national industrial policy that almost everyone<br>
  will agree to, or at least acquiesce to, perhaps for fear of being<br>
  labeled unpatriotic. Foreign enemies are the ultimate consumers of our<br>
  military preparations, so in the face of flagging demand for toasters<br>
  and SUVs our economy now arguably requires a growing supply of foreign<br>
  enemies." -Peter Montague<br>
  <br>
  Dr. Stan Monteith - "America has the best enemies that money can buy."<br>
  <br>
  H.L. Mencken, 1927<br>
  The whole aim of politics is to keep the populace<br>
  alarmed and hence clamoring to be led to freedom and<br>
  safety by menacing it with an endless array of<br>
  hobgoblins, all of them imaginary.<br>

  "Please, don't take terrorism lightly. Your supporters and the people who
  can't stand you are in grave danger from terrorists who want us all dead. I
  don't care if you tap my phone, learn what library books I read and learn
  everything about me, if it helps with terrorism I fully support it.
  Hopefully by invading everyone's privacy you will find out information to
  keep us all safe and in turn my three grandsons can live a safe life in our
  wonderful America." - Ruth West, 60, retired in Tucson, to pres. GWB in AZ

  "I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties
  than standing armies... if the American people ever allow private banks to
  control the issue of currency...the banks and corporations that will grow
  up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children
  will wake up homeless on the continent that their fathers conquered." -<br>

  "The stranger that is within thee shall get up above thee very high; and
  thou shalt come down very low. He shall lend to thee, and thou shalt not
  lend to him; he shall be the head, and thou shalt be the tail" [Bible -
  Deut. 28: 44-45]<br>
  <br>
  The modern banking system manufactures money out of nothing. The process is
  perhaps the most astonishing piece of slight of hand ever invented. If you
  want to continue to be the slaves of the bankers, and pay the cost of your
  own slavery, then let bankers continue to create money, and control credit.

  "First they came for the Communists, but I was not a Communist, so I said
  nothing. Then they came for the Social Democrats, but I was not a Social
  Democrat, so I did nothing. Then came the Trade Unionists, but I was not a
  Trade Unionist. And then they came for the Jews, but I was not a Jew, so I
  did little. Then, when they came for me, there was no one left to stand up
  for me." Pastor Niemoller, arrested in Germany by the Nazis and thrown in

  George W. Bush just after September 11:<br>
  Theirs is the worst kind of cruelty, the cruelty that is fed, not weakened,
  by tears. Theirs is the worst kind of violence, pure malice, while daring
  to call on the authority of God. We cannot fully understand the designs and
  power of Evil. It is enough to know that Evil, like Goodness, exists, and
  in the terrorist, Evil has found a willing servant.<br>

  from 'Team America: World Police' - Gary: We're dicks! We're reckless,
  arrogant, stupid dicks! And the Film Actors' Guild!.. are pussies. And Kim
  Jong Il!.. is an asshole. Pussies don't like dicks!.. because pussies get
  fucked by dicks. But dicks also fuck assholes. Assholes who just want to
  shit on everything. Pussies may think they can deal with assholes their
  way, but the only thing that can fuck an asshole... is a dick... with some
  balls. The problem with dicks is that sometimes they fuck too much, or fuck
  when it isn't appropriate, and it takes a pussy to show 'em that. But
  sometimes pussies get so full of shit that they become assholes themselves.
  Because pussies are only an inch and a half away from assholes. I don't
  know much in this crazy, crazy world, but I do know that if you don't let
  us fuck this asshole, we are gonna have our dicks and our pussies... all
  covered in shit.<br>

  "One final paragraph of advice: Do not burn yourselves out. Be as I am — a
  reluctant enthusiast, a part-time crusader, a half-hearted fanatic. Save
  the other half of yourselves and your lives for pleasure and adventure. It
  is not enough to fight for natural land and the west; it is even more
  important to enjoy it. While you can. While it's still there. So get out
  there and hunt and fish and mess around with your friends, ramble out
  yonder and explore the forests, encounter the grizzly, climb the mountains,
  bag the peaks, run the rivers, breath deep of that yet sweet and lucid air,
  sit quietly for awhile and contemplate the precious stillness, that lovely,
  mysterious and awesome space. Enjoy yourselves, keep your brain in your
  head and your head firmly attached to the body, the body active and alive,
  and I promise you this much: I promise you this one sweet victory over our
  enemies, over those deskbound men with their hearts in a safe deposit box
  and their eyes hypnotized by desk calculators. I promise you this: you will
  outlive the bastards."<br>
