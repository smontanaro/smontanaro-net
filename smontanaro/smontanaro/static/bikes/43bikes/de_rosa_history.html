          <i>from <a href="http://www.derosanews.com/">De Rosa site</a></i>
          <p>Ugo De Rosa was born on the 27th of January 1934 in Milan,
          Italy. He<br>
          attended primary school, middle school and a technical school where
          he<br>
          followed a mechanical and engineering curriculum. He developed a
          passion<br>
          for bicycle racing as a young boy, a passion which remains with him
          to<br>
          this day. It first led him to take up the sport of racing in which
          he<br>
          advanced through several ranks at the amateur level. But he also
          became<br>
          very interested the science of the bicycle itself, and this proved
          to<br>
          be the area where DeRosa would make his mark on the cycling
          world.<br>
          <br>
          His first job was in the work shop of an uncle where he repaired
          and<br>
          assembled bicycles. In the early fifties Ugo De Rosa opened his
          first<br>
          shop and dedicated himself to the manufacture of racing bicycles.
          He<br>
          understood what it took to build a true racing bicycle and his<br>
          reputation began to spread among the amateur racers in Milan. By
          1958<br>
          the word of De Rosa's frames had reached the professional peleton.
          While<br>
          attending a race at the Vigorelli velodrome in Milan De Rosa
          was<br>
          approached by a famous cyclist of the day, Raphael Geminiani. He
          asked<br>
          De Rosa to build him a bike for the upcoming Giro d'Italia. De
          Rosa<br>
          responded immediately to Geminiani's request, for he knew that
          making<br>
          this champion's bikes would certify his craftsmanship and launch
          him<br>
          into the world of professional cycling.<br>
          <br>
          The sixties saw De Rosa bikes become a fixture in the
          professional<br>
          peleton. The powerful Faema squad was the first team to ride De
          Rosas to<br>
          the forefront with great champions like Soler and Suarez of Spain.
          Along<br>
          with Belgian Rik van Loy they won a majority of the races they
          entered.<br>
          Other De Rosa teams of the decade included Tbac (1964) and Max
          Majer (1967).<br>
          <br>
          In 1969 De Rosa was approached by Gianni Motta, a great champion
          of<br>
          that era who had admired the bicycles of the Max Majer team.
          Motta<br>
          wanted to engage De Rosa as his frame builder and mechanic, De
          Rosa<br>
          accepted and became the bicycle supplier to Motta's powerful
          Sanson<br>
          team as well. It was also during this period that one of the
          greatest<br>
          stars of cycling was rising - Eddy Merckx. DeRosa built some frames
          for<br>
          Merckx around this time, but it was not until 1973 that their
          now<br>
          famous relationship was formalized.<br>
          <br>
          That was when Eddy asked Ugo to become the official frame builder
          and<br>
          mechanic for the Molteni team which he captained. The results
          were<br>
          unprecedented as Merckx and his teammates won nearly all the major
          races<br>
          including the Tour de France, the Giro d'Italia, Milano-San Remo
          and<br>
          the World Championship. This partnership remained in effect
          until<br>
          Merckx's retirement in 1978. In 1981 Eddy again called upon his
          former<br>
          frame builder to be a technical consultant when he first set up his
          own<br>
          bicycle manufacturing facility. De Rosa's talents were, however,
          in<br>
          great demand by the mid- seventies.<br>
          <br>
          In 1974 another great racer came to him in search of the frame that
          was<br>
          the talk of the pro peleton. Francesco Moser wanted De Rosa
          bicycles for<br>
          his Filotex team. De Rosa complied and the results were rewarding
          for<br>
          both parties. The team was taken over by Sanson in 1976, and it
          added<br>
          the powerful Belgian Roger DeVlaeminck to its roster while Moser
          went<br>
          on to win the World Championship.<br>
          <br>
          So as the seventies came to a close Ugo De Rosa had gone from
          the<br>
          humble beginnings in his uncle's repair shop to becoming the
          frame<br>
          builder of two World Champions. De Rosa's personal life was as
          rewarding<br>
          as his professional one. His wife and sons had always been
          supportive of<br>
          him, and as the seventies were coming to a close his sons
          Danilo,<br>
          Doriano, and Cristiano were showing great interest in the
          family<br>
          business. The timing could not have been better as the demand for
          De<br>
          Rosa bicycles skyrocketed in the eighties as De Rosa had entered
          new<br>
          markets for the first time including the United States, Russia,
          Japan,<br>
          Belgium, and Germany<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          The sport side of the business continued to grow for De Rosa in
          the<br>
          eighties as well. In 1982 he sponsored the Sammontana team led by
          Moreno<br>
          Argentin and Giovanbattista Baronchelli. From 1985 to 1989 De
          Rosa<br>
          worked with the Ariostea team which grew from a small start-up team
          to<br>
          one of the dominant squads in the peleton by the end of the
          decade.<br>
          <br>
          The end of the eighties also saw De Rosa outgrow the small work
          shop<br>
          adjacent to his home where all his frames had been made, and he
          moved to<br>
          a larger space in Cusano Milanino and assigned his sons
          definite<br>
          responsibilities. Danilo and Doriano learned well from their father
          and<br>
          started to work beside him in the most critical phases of frame<br>
          construction while Cristiano took over the commercial side of the
          business.<br>
          <br>
          In 1990 Ugo De Rosa embarked on a new project to build bicycle
          frames<br>
          from titanium tubes which would stand up to rigors of
          professional<br>
          racing and have the ride quality of a DeRosa. Ugo spent over three
          years<br>
          in the research and development phase of this project. In 1994 the
          final<br>
          results were delivered to the Gewiss team in the form of the De
          Rosa<br>
          Titanio. The results were fantastic, and the Gewiss team won
          the<br>
          following races:<br>
          <br>
          •Milano-Sanremo (G. Furlan)<br>
          •Liege-Bastogne-Liege (E. Berzin)<br>
          •Freccia Vallone (Argentin, Furlan, Berzin, una pagina storica
          del<br>
          ciclismo: tre corridori della stessa squadra arrivano al
          traguardo)<br>
          •77 Giro d'Italia (E. Berzin, un russo di talento vince a soli 23
          anni,<br>
          battendo un corridore esperto come M. Induran)<br>
          <br>
          •Giro di francia (P. Ugrumov â “ se“ secondo posto)<br>
          •Giro di Lombardia (V. Bobrik)<br>
          <br>
          The Gewiss team collected over 40 victories in 1994, verifying<br>
          DeRosa's R&amp;D on his titanium project.<br>
          <br>
          The Gewiss team collected over 40 victories in 1994, verifying
          De<br>
          Rosa's titanium frame concept. Today the De Rosa family continues
          to<br>
          build the finest bicycles they know how to while constantly
          searching<br>
          for ways to improve their product. Ugo, Danilo, Doriano, and
          Cristiano<br>
          have come a long way since Ugo entered that first race some forty
          years ago.</p>
