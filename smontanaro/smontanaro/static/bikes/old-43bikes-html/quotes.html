Tell me what you know.&quot; Ralph Waldo Emerson <br>			<br>			Those who are awake live in a state of constant amazement. &#151; The Buddha  <br>			<br>			Taisen Deshimaru &quot;The Ring of the Way&quot; 1983<br>			My master (Kodo Sawaki) used to say that living our lives is like riding a bicycle, you have to have practiced. If body and brain are too stiff you cannot do it. You cannot keep your balance. To ride a bicycle you have to pedal all the time. If you don't pedal you don't go forward, and if you lean over too far you fall down. We have to use our brain like a bicycle. In this exact instant in that exact way. Each instant is different. Here and now changes every instant so our brains must not be one-sided if we decide things according to our own mental categories alone. Our brain does not develop and cannot act with wisdom.<br>			<br>			&ldquo;Believe that you can&rsquo;t, or believe that you can. Either way, you&rsquo;re right.&quot; --- Henry Ford <br>			<br>			&quot;Truth is a pathless land.&quot;  Krishnamurti<br>			<br>			As far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain; and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality. -Einstein<br>		</p>		<p>F. Scott Fitzgerald: &quot;The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two conflicting ideas in mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function.&quot;<br>			<br>			&quot;The answer that you want lies in the question that you state.&quot; -Claudio Sanchez<br>			<br>			&quot;Chaos is a name for any order that produces confusion in our minds.&quot; <br>			- George Santayana <br>			<br>			&quot;More than any time in history, mankind faces a crossroads. One path<br>			leads to despair and utter hopelessness, the other to total extinction. Let us pray that we have the wisdom to choose correctly.&quot;<br>			Woody Allen <br>			<br>			Sometimes I wonder whether the world is being run by smart people who are putting us on or by imbeciles who really mean it. - Mark Twain <br>			<br>				Quis costodiet ipsos custodies? (Who will watch the watchers?) -Juvenal, c. 55-128 AD<br>		</p>		<p>			 In our country we have those three unspeakably precious things:  <br>			freedom of speech, freedom of conscience, and the prudence       <br>			never to practice either of them.                 --Mark Twain <br>			<br>			&quot; Never ascribe to malice that which is adequately<br>			explained by incompetence.&quot; - Napoleon Bonaparte<br>			<br>			&quot;The human race has one really effective weapon, and that is laughter.&quot; -Mark Twain<br>			<br>				- Mass movements can rise and spread without belief in a god, but never<br>				without belief in a devil.<br>				- Eric Hoffer: The True Believer.<br>			<br>			&quot;They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety.&quot; <br>			-Benjamin Franklin <br>			<br>			&quot;Well, I say 'yes' to this constitution, with all its faults. We need good governance for a while, and this constitution will assure us of good governance for a number of years.&quot; This constitution will fail, as others have before it, and that will be due to the corruption of the people, for whom in the end only despotism will serve.&quot; -- Benjamin Franklin<br>			<br>			&quot;The notion that a radical is one who hates his country is na&iuml;ve and usually idiotic. He is, more likely, one who likes his country more than the rest of us, and is thus more disturbed than the rest of us when he sees it debauched. He is not a bad citizen turning to crime; he is a good citizen driven to despair.&quot; -- H. L. Mencken<br>		</p>		<p>&quot;When the tyrant has disposed of foreign enemies by conquest or treaty, and there is nothing more to fear from them, then he is always stirring up some war or other, in order that the people may require a leader.&quot; -- Plato <br>			<br>			H. L. Mencken: &quot;The most popular man under a democracy is not the most democratic man, but the most despotic man. The common folk delight in the exaction's of such a man. They like him to boss them. Their natural gait is the goosestep.&quot;<br>			<br>			&quot;Let them protest as much as they want, as long as they pay their taxes.&quot;<br>				Alexander Haig<br>			<br>			The secret of great wealth with no obvious source is some forgotten crime, <br>			forgotten because it was done neatly. <br>			--Balzac <br>			<br>			&quot;The most dangerous man, to any government, is the man who is able to think things out for himself... Almost inevitably, he comes to the conclusion that the government he lives under is dishonest, insane and intolerable.&quot; H.L. Mencken <br>			<br>			There are three classes of men; lovers of wisdom, lovers of honor, and lovers of gain.<br>			-Plato <br>			<br>				Abraham Lincoln (disputed):<br>			I see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me, and causes me to tremble for the safety of our country.  Corporations have been enthroned, an era of corruption will follow, and the money power of the country will endeavor to prolong its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people, until the wealth is aggregated in a few hands, and the republic is destroyed.  The Government should create, issue, and circulate all the currency, and credits needed to satisfy the spending power of the Government, and the buying power of consumers.  By the adoption of these principals, the taxpayers will be saving immense sums of interest.  Money will cease to be master, and become the servant of humanity.<br>			<br>			&quot;First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you,<br>			then you win.&quot;- Mahatma Gandhi (1869-1948)<br>			<br>			&quot;Play for more than you can afford to lose and you will return to learn again.&quot;  -Winston Churchill<br>			<br>			&quot;gas is running low .&nbsp; . .&quot;  -last transmitted words of Amelia Earhart<br>			<br>			&quot;Keeping America competitive requires affordable energy.  And here we have a serious problem: America is addicted to oil, which is often imported from unstable parts of the world.&quot; -George W. Bush in his '06 State of the Union Address<br>				Conservation may be a sign of personal virtue but it is not a sufficient basis for a sound, comprehensive energy policy. -Dick Cheney<br>		</p>		<p>	The American way of life is non-negotiable - George HW Bush 1992<br>		</p>		<p>&quot;My father rode a camel; I drive a car; my son flies a jet; his son will ride a camel.&quot; --Saudi saying<br>			<br>			&quot;You meet your destiny on the road you take to avoid it.&quot;-Carl Jung <br>			<br>			The shoe that fits one person pinches another. -Carl Jung <br>			<br>			Man invented language to satisfy his deep need to complain. -- Lily Tomlin <br>			<br>			Frank Layden, Utah Jazz president, on a former player: &quot;I told him, 'Son, what is it with you? Is it ignorance or apathy?' He said, 'Coach, I don't know and I don't care.'&quot; <br>			<br>			&quot;The whole suburban project can be summarized pretty succinctly as the greatest misallocation of resources in the history of the world. America took all its post-war wealth and invested it in a living arrangement that has no future.&quot;  James Howard Kunstler<br>			<br>			&quot;To go from a job you don't like to watching on a screen on which others live more intensely than you... is American life by and large.&quot; Michael Ventura<br>			<br>			There is nothing I love more than making some riled-up prick with no sense of humor angry enough to compose an epic, right-wing political manifesto, only to have me scan and delete it in three seconds.  -the Wacky Iraqi - http://www.wackyiraqi.com<br>		</p>		<p>We've heard that a million monkeys <br>			at a million keyboards could produce <br>			the complete works of Shakespeare; <br>			now, thanks to the Internet, we know <br>			that it is not true.  -Robert Wilensky<br>			<br>				Arguing on the internet is like running in the special olympics, even if<br>				you win, you're still a retard. --?<br>		</p>		<p>Government is the Entertainment Division of&nbsp;<br>				the military-industrial complex. -- Frank Zappa<br>			<br>			&quot;Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, from those who are cold and are not clothed. <br>			&ldquo;The world in arms is not spending money alone. It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children.&rdquo;<br>			&#151; President Dwight D. Eisenhower <br>				April 16, 1953<br>			<br>			&quot;The biggest downside to a war in Iraq is what you could do with that money. What does a war in Iraq cost a week? A billion? Maybe a billion a day? The budget for the National Cancer Institute is four billion. That has to change. It needs to become a priority again.&quot; -Lance Armstrong '05<br>			<br>			&quot;We are now at a point where we must educate our children in what no one knew yesterday, and prepare our schools for what no one knows yet.&quot; Margaret Mead<br>			<br>			&quot;Act as if the principle by which you act were about to be turned into a universal law of nature&quot;. --Immanuel Kant <br>			<br>			When you row another person across the river, you get there yourself.<br>				-Fortune Cookie<br>			&nbsp;<br>			&quot;You may never know what results come from your action.

Mary Rose) <br>			<br>			&ldquo;Beauty? Let me tell you something  being thought of as a beautiful woman has spared me nothing in life. No heartache, no trouble. Love has been difficult. Beauty is essentially meaningless and it is always transitory.&rdquo;<br>			 - Halle Berry, in an AP interview<br>			<br>				Femininity appears to be one of those pivotal qualities that is so important no one can define it.<br>				-Caroline Bird<br>			<br>			&quot;...fishing the past, from the disposal, wiping it off, painting over<br>			the ugly parts and recycling it for more than it's worth.&quot;<br>				--Kurt Vonnegut<br>			<br>			&quot;Our close cousins the gorillas and orangs and chimps and gibbon apes have gotten along fine all this time while eating raw vegetable matter, whereas we not only prepare hot meals but have now all but destroyed this once salubrious planet as a life-support system in fewer than 200 years, mainly by making thermodynamic whoopee with fossil fuels.&quot;<br>			-Kurt Vonnegut  'Man Without a Country' 2005<br>			<br>			&quot;The devil can cite scripture for his purpose.&quot; -William Shakespeare<br>			<br>			&ldquo;Our neoconservatives are neither new nor conservative, but old as Babylon and evil as Hell.&rdquo;-- Edward Abbey <br>			<br>			 Extremism is so easy. You've got your position, and that's it. It doesn't take much thought. And when you go far enough to the right, you meet the same idiots coming around from the left. -Clint Eastwood feb '05<br>			<br>				You can safely assume you've created God in your<br>				own image when it turns out that God hates all the<br>			same people you do.&quot;  -- Anne Lamott<br>			&nbsp;<br>			That which is looked upon by one generation as the apex of human knowledge is often considered an absurdity by the next, and that which is regarded as a superstition in one century may form the basis of science for the following one. --Paracelsus <br>			<br>			Work and play are words used to describe the same thing under differing conditions.  -Mark Twain<br>			&nbsp;<br>			&quot;Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed people can change the world.

For if it prosper, none dare call it Treason.&quot; <br>				--Sir John Harrington<br>		</p>		<p>	Almost all of human behavior and activity is not essentially any different from animal behavior. The<br>				most advanced technologies and craftsmanship bring us at best up to the super-chimpanzee level. Actually,<br>				the gap between say Plato or Nietzsche and the average human is greater than the gap between that<br>				chimpanzee and the average human. The realm of the real spirit, the true artist, the saint, the philosopher, is<br>				rarely achieved. Why so few? Why is world history and evolution not stories of progress but rather this<br>			endless and futile addition of zeroes?  -Timothy Leary in 'Waking Life'-1<br>			<br>			&quot;Our modern skulls house a stone age mind&quot; Leda Cosmides<br>			<br>			&quot;In the first place, I put forth a general inclination of all mankind a<br>				perpetual and restless desire of power after power, that ceaseth only in<br>			death.&quot; -- Thomas Hobbes<br>			<br>			You mean, you'll put down your rock and I'll put down my sword and we'll try and kill each other like civilized people?<br>			-The Man in Black, 'The Princess Bride'<br>			<br>			&quot;Wherever men hold unequal power in society, they will strive to maintain<br>			it.  They will use whatever means are convenient to that end and will seek<br>			to justify them by the most plausible arguments they are able to devise.&quot; --<br>			Reinhold Neibuhr <br>			<br>			&quot;In fact, telling primates (human or otherwise) that their reasoning<br>				architectures evolved in large part to solve problems of dominance is a<br>				little like telling fish that their gills evolved in large part to solve the<br>			problem of oxygen intake from water.&quot;  -- Denise Dellarosa Cummins<br>			<br>			&quot;Wise men learn more from fools than fools from the wise.&quot; - fortune cookie<br>			<br>			&quot;... it became clear to me that our present economic system<br>				was totally unsustainable and self-destructive.<br>				It seemed little more than a well-organized<br>				method for converting natural resources<br>			into garbage.&quot;-- Jay Hanson<br>			<br>				As far as converting THIS society to solar,<br>			I think it's literally impossible.  Even if political<br>				and economic barriers are ignored, there are<br>				not enough natural resources left to rebuild<br>				the existing infrastructure--to move everyone<br>				out of existing hot, dry cities (esp. Los Angeles,<br>				San Diego, Phoenix, Las Vegas, etc.)<br>				and house them elsewhere in high-density,<br>				low-energy structures.<br>			<br>				America was built on the belief that fossil<br>				fuel would last forever. It was<br>				in our genes. We had no choice.--Jay Hanson<br>			<br>				- The destruction of the natural world is not the result of<br>				global capitalism, industrialization, 'Western civilization'<br>			or any flaw in human institutions. It is a consequence of <br>			the evolutionary success of an exceptionally rapacious <br>			primate. Throughout all of history and prehistory, human <br>				advance has coincided with ecological devastation.<br>			John Gray, &quot;Straw Dogs&quot;<br>			<br>				Providing for one's family as a good husband and father is a water-tight excuse for making money hand over fist. Greed may be a sin, exploitation of other people might, on the face of it, look rather nasty, but who can blame a man for ''doing the best'' for his children??<br>				-Eva Figes<br>			<br>			&quot;He who joyfully marches in rank and file has already earned my contempt. He has been given a large brain by mistake, since for him the spinal cord would suffice.&quot; -- Albert Einstein&nbsp;<br>			&quot; If one advances confidently in the direction of their dreams, <br>			And endeavors to lead a life which they have imagined, <br>			They will meet with a success unexpected in common hours.&quot; <br>			--Henry David Thoreau <br>			&nbsp;<br>			&quot;Thousands of candles can be lighted from a single candle, and the life of the candle will not be shortened. Happiness never decreases by being shared.&quot; -Buddha <br>			&nbsp;<br>			Yeshe Aro's prescription for happiness: &quot;On this depends my liberation: to assist others - nothing else.&quot; <br>			&nbsp;<br>			Seriousness is the last refuge of the shallow.  --Oscar Wilde<br>			<br>			&quot;The spirits will warn you twice, but the third time you stand  alone.&quot;  American Indian saying<br>			<br>			The forces we must face are formidable, but the only alternative is annihilation. Still the man-made system cannot be corrected by any means that requires one's will to be forced upon another, for that is the source of the problem. If people are to correct themselves and their leaders, the gulf between the two must disappear. To accomplish this one can only rely on the energy of truth itself. - from Hopi website &lt;http://www.ausbcomp.com/redman/hopi.htm&gt;<br>			<br>			&quot;You cannot solve a problem on the same level that it was created. <br>			You must rise above it to the next level.&quot; --Albert Einstein<br>			<br>			Believe nothing because a wise man said it. Believe nothing because it is generally held. Believe nothing because it is written. Believe nothing because it is said to be divine. Believe nothing because someone else believes it. But believe only what you yourself judge to be true. --Buddha <br>			<br>			&quot;All men are mortal. Socrates was mortal. Therefore, all men are<br>			Socrates.&quot; --Woody Allen<br>			<br>			Political language -- and with variations this is true of all political parties, from Conservatives to Anarchists -- is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable. <br>			George Orwell, 1946 <br>			<br>			&quot;The earth is not dying. It is being killed, and the people killing it have names and addresses.&quot; -- Utah Phillips<br>			<br>			You shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free. --Jesus Christ <br>			<br>			John Muir: <br>			&quot;When one tugs at a single thing in nature, one finds it attached to the rest of the world.&quot; <br>			<br>			&quot;Cut 'em low, boys. Cut 'em low.&quot; -dying words of George Weyerhauser<br>			<br>			&quot;In the event that I am reincarnated, I would like to return as a deadly virus, in order to contribute something to solve overpopulation&quot; HRH Prince Philip  <br>			<br>			&ldquo;Illegitimi Non Carborundum&rdquo; Don't let the bastards grind you down&nbsp;<br>			<br>				In politics stupidity is not a handicap. --Napoleon<br>			<br>			J.P.

Channel One was propaganda. Channel Two consisted of a KGB officer telling you: Turn back at once to Channel One.?<br>				-Yakov Smirnoff<br>			<br>				Anyone who believes exponential growth can go on forever in a<br>				finite world is either a madman or an economist. --Kenneth Boulding<br>			<br>				Arthur Schopenhauer<br>			All truth passes through three stages. First it is ridiculed, second  it is violently opposed, and third, it is accepted as self-evident <br>			<br>				Jackie Collins- Hollywood Kids<br>				Halfway down the freeway it occurred to Michael that he hadn't been thorough enough in searching through Rita's dirty laundry.<br>			<br>				If you want to know what God thinks of money, just look at the people he<br>				gave it to. - Dorothy Parker<br>			<br>			&quot;Let me tell you about the very rich. They are different from you and<br>				me. They possess and enjoy early, and it does something to them, makes<br>				them soft where we are hard, and cynical where we are trustful, in a<br>				way that, unless you were born rich, it is very difficult to<br>				understand. They think, deep in their hearts, that they are better<br>				than we are because we had to discover the compensations and refuges<br>				of life for ourselves. Even when they enter deep into our world or<br>				sink below us, they still think that they are better than we are. They<br>			are different.&quot; --F. Scott Fitzgerald<br>			<br>			Recollection of the outward events of my life has largely faded or disappeared. But my encounters with the &quot;other&quot; reality, my bouts with the unconscious, are indelibly engraved on my memory. In that realm there has always been wealth in abundance, and everything else has lost importance by comparison. --Carl Jung <br>			<br>				What you know you can't explain, but you feel it. You've felt it your entire life, that there's something wrong with the world.

It both emboldens the blood, just as it narrows the mind. And when the drums of war have reached a fever pitch and the blood boils with hate and the mind has closed, the leader will have no need in seizing the rights of the citizenry. Rather, the citizenry, infused with fear and blinded by patriotism, will offer up all of their rights unto the leader and gladly so. How do I know? For this is what I have done.

Roosevelt <br>			<br>			&quot;It is well enough that people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system, for if they did, I believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning.&quot; Henry Ford. <br>			<br>			&quot;Beware the bearers of false gifts and their broken promises. Much PAIN but still time.&nbsp; BELIEVE.&nbsp; There is GOOD out there.&nbsp; We oppose DECEPTION.&nbsp;Conduit CLOSING,&quot; - message (unencrypted) from Chilbolton glyph crop circle Aug 2002<br>			<br>			&quot;The great masses of people will more easily fall victims to a big lie than to a small one. Especially if it is repeated over and over.&quot; <br>			-- Adolph Hitler <br>			<br>				Hermann Goering, Nazi Leader in 1939 Germany<br>			Of course the people don't want war...that is understood. But voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders.  That's easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and for exposing the country to danger. It works the same in any country.&quot; <br>			<br>			&quot;Defense is the only national industrial policy that almost everyone<br>				will agree to, or at least acquiesce to, perhaps for fear of being<br>				labeled unpatriotic. Foreign enemies are the ultimate consumers of our<br>				military preparations, so in the face of flagging demand for toasters<br>				and SUVs our economy now arguably requires a growing supply of foreign<br>			enemies.&quot;  -Peter Montague<br>			<br>			Dr. Stan Monteith - &quot;America has the best enemies that money can buy.&quot; <br>			<br>			 H.L. Mencken, 1927<br>			The whole aim of politics is to keep the populace <br>				alarmed and hence clamoring to be led to freedom and<br>			safety by menacing it with an endless array of <br>				hobgoblins, all of them imaginary.<br>			<br>			&quot;Please, don't take terrorism lightly. Your supporters and the people who can't stand you are in grave danger from terrorists who want us all dead. I don't care if you tap my phone, learn what library books I read and learn everything about me, if it helps with terrorism I fully support it. Hopefully by invading everyone's privacy you will find out information to keep us all safe and in turn my three grandsons can live a safe life in our wonderful America.&quot; - Ruth West, 60, retired in Tucson, to pres. GWB in AZ Star aug '03<br>			<br>			In the end they will lay their freedom at our feet and say to us, 'Make us your slaves, but feed us' --The Grand Inquisitor, in The Brothers Karamazov by Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoevsky -1879 <br>			<br>			&quot;The best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average voter.&quot;  Winston Churchill<br>			<br>			Mundus Vult Decepi - The World Wants to be Deceived <br>			<br>			&quot;I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies... if the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of currency...the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children will wake up homeless on the continent that their fathers conquered.&quot; - <br>			--Thomas Jefferson <br>			<br>			&quot;The stranger that is within thee shall get up above thee very high; and thou shalt come down very low. He shall lend to thee, and thou shalt not lend to him; he shall be the head, and thou shalt be the tail&quot; [Bible - Deut. 28: 44-45] <br>			<br>			The modern banking system manufactures money out of nothing. The process is perhaps the most astonishing piece of slight of hand ever invented. If you want to continue to be the slaves of the bankers, and pay the cost of your own slavery, then let bankers continue to create money, and control credit. ~ Sir John Stamp (former governor of the Bank of England) <br>			<br>			&quot;The opinion of 10,000 men is of no value if none of them know anything about the subject.&quot; <br>			-- Marcus Aurelius, Roman Emperor from 121-180 A.D. and Stoic philosopher <br>			<br>			&quot;The only thing worth globalizing is dissent.&quot; -- Arundhati Roy <br>			<br>			Seven Blunders Of The World <br>				That Lead To Violence:<br>			Wealth without work <br>			Science without humanity <br>			Pleasure without conscience <br>			Worship without sacrifice <br>			Knowledge without character <br>			Politics without principle <br>			Commerce without morality-  Mahatma Gandhi <br>			<br>				?We are stripped bare by the curse of plenty.?<br>				-Winston Churchill<br>			<br>			&quot;This country, with its institutions, belongs to the people who inhabit it. Whenever they shall grow weary of the existing Goverment, they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it or their revolutionary right to dismember or overthrow it.&quot; -- Abraham Lincoln, 1861 <br>			<br>			&quot;When you give food to the poor, they call you a saint. When you ask why the poor have no food, they call you a communist.&quot; -- Archbishop Helder Camara, Brazilian liberation theologist <br>			<br>			&quot;First they came for the Communists, but I was not a Communist, so I said nothing.  Then they came for the Social Democrats, but I was not a Social Democrat, so I did nothing.  Then came the Trade Unionists, but I was not a Trade Unionist.  And then they came for the Jews, but I was not a Jew, so I did little.  Then, when they came for me, there was no one left to stand up for me.&quot; Pastor Niemoller, arrested in Germany by the Nazis and thrown in jail<br>			<br>			&quot;Under communism man exploits man; under capitalism the opposite is true.&quot; -??<br>			<br>				?The inherent vice of capitalism is the unequal sharing of blessings; the inherent vice of socialism is the equal sharing of miseries.?<br>				-Winston Churchill<br>			<br>			&quot;What difference does it make to the dead, the orphans, and the homeless, whether the mad destruction is brought under the name of totalitarianism or the holy name of liberty and democracy?&quot; - Mahatma Gandhi <br>			<br>			&quot;The greatest purveyor of violence on earth is my own government.&quot; --- Martin Luther King, Jr. <br>			<br>			George W. Bush just after September 11: <br>				Theirs is the worst kind of cruelty, the cruelty that is fed, not weakened, by tears. Theirs is the worst kind of violence, pure malice, while daring to call on the authority of God. We cannot fully understand the designs and power of Evil. It is enough to know that Evil, like Goodness, exists, and in the terrorist, Evil has found a willing servant.<br>			<br>			&quot;The process of transformation, even if it brings revolutionary change, is likely to be a long one, absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event -- like a new Pearl Harbor&quot; (2000) <br>			-- Project for a  New American Century <br>			<br>			&quot;We must speak the truth about terror. Let us never tolerate outrageous conspiracy theories concerning the attacks of September the 11th, <br>			malicious lies that attempt to shift the blame away from the terrorists themselves, away from the guilty.&quot; <br>			GW Bush speaking before the UN General Assembly 11/10/2001 <br>			<br>			from 'Team America: World Police' -  Gary: We're dicks! We're reckless, arrogant, stupid dicks! And the Film Actors' Guild!.. are pussies. And Kim Jong Il!.. is an asshole. Pussies don't like dicks!.. because pussies get fucked by dicks. But dicks also fuck assholes. Assholes who just want to shit on everything. Pussies may think they can deal with assholes their way, but the only thing that can fuck an asshole... is a dick... with some balls. The problem with dicks is that sometimes they fuck too much, or fuck when it isn't appropriate, and it takes a pussy to show 'em that. But sometimes pussies get so full of shit that they become assholes themselves. Because pussies are only an inch and a half away from assholes. I don't know much in this crazy, crazy world, but I do know that if you don't let us fuck this asshole, we are gonna have our dicks and our pussies... all covered in shit.<br>			<br>			&quot;One final paragraph of advice: Do not burn yourselves out. Be as I am &#151; a reluctant enthusiast, a part-time crusader, a half-hearted fanatic. Save the other half of yourselves and your lives for pleasure and adventure. It is not enough to fight for natural land and the west; it is even more important to enjoy it. While you can. While it's still there. So get out there and hunt and fish and mess around with your friends, ramble out yonder and explore the forests, encounter the grizzly, climb the mountains, bag the peaks, run the rivers, breath deep of that yet sweet and lucid air, sit quietly for awhile and contemplate the precious stillness, that lovely, mysterious and awesome space. Enjoy yourselves, keep your brain in your head and your head firmly attached to the body, the body active and alive, and I promise you this much: I promise you this one sweet victory over our enemies, over those deskbound men with their hearts in a safe deposit box and their eyes hypnotized by desk calculators. I promise you this: you will outlive the bastards.&quot; <br>			&#151; Edward Abbey <br>			<br>			&quot;Train, say your prayers, and take your vitamins&quot; --Hulk Hogan <br>		</p>	</body><!-- Start of TheCounter.com Code --><SCRIPT TYPE="text/javascript" LANGUAGE="javascript">s="na";c="na";j="na";f=""+escape(document.referrer)</SCRIPT><SCRIPT TYPE="text/javascript" LANGUAGE="javascript1.2">s=screen.width;v=navigator.appNameif (v != "Netscape") {c=screen.colorDepth}else {c=screen.pixelDepth}j=navigator.javaEnabled()</SCRIPT><SCRIPT TYPE="text/javascript" LANGUAGE="javascript">function pr(n) {document.write(n,"\n");}NS2Ch=0if (navigator.appName == "Netscape" &&navigator.appVersion.charAt(0) == "2") {NS2Ch=1}if (NS2Ch == 0) {r="&size="+s+"&colors="+c+"&referer="+f+"&java="+j+""pr("<A HREF=\"http://www.TheCounter.com\" TARGET=\"_top\"><IMG"+" BORDER=0 SRC=\"http://c3.thecounter.com/id=2598781"+r+"\"><\/A>")}</SCRIPT><NOSCRIPT><A HREF="http://www.TheCounter.com" TARGET="_top"><IMGSRC="http://c3.thecounter.com/id=2598781" ALT="TC" BORDER=0></A></NOSCRIPT><!-- End of TheCounter.com Code --></html>
