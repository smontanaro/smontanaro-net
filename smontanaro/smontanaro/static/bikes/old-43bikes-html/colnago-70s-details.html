One list member has a '74 with no fork tangs at all. He also had a '74 that had a club in the bottom headlug and the SEAT lug only, none in top headlug (he suspects a stray leftover cutout seat lug). Another member also knows of an original '72 track bike with road blades in a Vagner crown and no chrome.

Last Year when Peter Rich was in Italy he made numerous inquiries about builders who would be able to supply us. We received samples of several different frames. After close examination of the frames workmanship, many months of testriding, it was decided that the frames built by Ernesto Colnago possessed excellent handling qualities and craftmanship. In the past we have dealt with other Italian builders and have sometimes waited two years to receive frames. We, therefore, made a preliminary order of ten frames, and we are happy in receiving the frames soon after placing the order.</b></font>					<p><font size="-1"><b>Meanwhile, last October two Velo-Sport employees were in Europe visiting various frame builders and bicycle manufactuers. Ther were most impressed by the shop facilities of Mr. Colnago. The shop is located about 20 miles outside of Milan in a new building , with six people working, including Mr. Colnago and his brother. They produce approximately 80 frames a month. The majority of these frames are ridden by Italian amateur and professional cyclists. He supplied frames for the 1960  and 1968 Italian Olympic team and the professional trade teams, Molteni and SCIC. Some of the prominent professional riders who will be riding Colnago frames next year are Eddy Merckx, Felice Gimondi, Gianna Motta and Michele Dancelli.</b></font></p>					<p><font size="-1"><b>Mr. Colnago has been involed in frame building and bicycle racing for many years. Each year, he serves as head mechanic for a trade team, for the Giro d' Italia and the Tour de France. He has also served as chief mechanic for the Italian national team in the Olyimpics and world championships. He either builds himself or closely supervises the construction of all his frames, unlike a number of other quality Italian frames imported into this country bearing one persons name, but built by someone else.</b></font></p>					<p><font size="-1"><b>We are thoroughly impressed with every aspect of Mr. Colnago's building ability. Because of this, we are happy to be the first importer of his bicycle into the country. At present, we have five frames left (two 54cm, 53cm, 56cm and 58cm). In January, we will receive twenty all blue completed bicycles, (two of sizes: 50, 52, 54, 56, 57, 58, 60, 62, and 64cm). In March or April, 100 frames are expected in assorted sizes and colors in addition to five track frames.</b></font></p>					<p><font size="-1"><b>We plan to keep 30 to 40 frames on hand at all times.
