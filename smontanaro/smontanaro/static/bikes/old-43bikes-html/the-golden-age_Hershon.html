						<div align="left">
							<p>You hear guys claim they remember &ldquo;better&nbsp;<br>
								days&rdquo; in road cycling. There were no better&nbsp;<br>
								days. Today is the best day.&nbsp;</p>
							<p>We never had the choices we have, several&nbsp;<br>
								fine alternatives for every consumer decision,&nbsp;<br>
								whether products or services. We&rsquo;ve never had&nbsp;<br>
								the convenience we have now.&nbsp;</p>
							<p>Examples? Back in the &rsquo;70s you could buy a&nbsp;<br>
								titanium frame. You still can. But the worst Ti&nbsp;<br>
								frame you can buy today is worlds better than&nbsp;<br>
								anything you could have bought then. No&nbsp;<br>
								comparison.&nbsp;</p>
							<p>And although the &rsquo;70s were the so-called&nbsp;<br>
								heyday of lugged steel frames, you can buy a&nbsp;<br>
								better lugged steel frame now than you could&rsquo;ve&nbsp;<br>
								then. Frames from many of today&rsquo;s builders are&nbsp;<br>
								finer, more fussed-over and better finished than&nbsp;<br>
								anything Cinelli, Hetchins, Singer or Confente&nbsp;<br>
								ever produced.&nbsp;</p>
							<p>Today you can also buy aluminum or carbon&nbsp;<br>
								fiber frames. You can buy aluminum frames with&nbsp;<br>
								carbon stays. You can buy composite aluminum&nbsp;<br>
								frames that won&rsquo;t behave the way aluminum&nbsp;<br>
								frames are reputed to behave.&nbsp;</p>
							<p>No doors are closed. If you still believe steel is&nbsp;<br>
								real, buy steel. Buy whatever you want, go for a&nbsp;<br>
								ride, then explain to me why the &ldquo;old days&rdquo; were&nbsp;<br>
								superior.&nbsp;</p>
							<p>You say you miss the oneness you used to&nbsp;<br>
								feel with your bike when friction held your bike in&nbsp;<br>
								gear? Buy an old parts group, new in the box.&nbsp;<br>
								Buy used parts. Or buy a 9- or 10-speed group&nbsp;<br>
								or Mavic&rsquo;s electronic Mektronic shifting. You&rsquo;ve&nbsp;<br>
								never had so many options.&nbsp;</p>
							<p>In the &rsquo;70s, you leaned over a sink and hand-&nbsp;<br>
								washed your wool cycling clothing. That stuff&nbsp;<br>
								took hours to dry, hanging on a line. It shrank&nbsp;<br>
								anyway. Shorts rode up, arm and leg warmers&nbsp;<br>
								fell down. There was no woman-specific&nbsp;<br>
								clothing.&nbsp;</p>
							<p>No bike clothing had style. Style was inauthen-&nbsp;<br>
								tic; no one wanted it. Did Fausto Coppi&rsquo;s&nbsp;<br>
								clothing have style? Hell no.&nbsp;</p>
							<p>Today, all bicycle clothing is easy to wash.&nbsp;<br>
								Almost all of it can be machine dried without&nbsp;<br>
								shortening the life of the garment. You can buy&nbsp;<br>
								jerseys and shorts made to fit women. You can&nbsp;<br>
								buy comfortable, stylish, long-wearing clothing&nbsp;<br>
								at a wide range of price levels.&nbsp;</p>
							<p>If you still want to wear what you wore in the&nbsp;<br>
								&rsquo;70s, embroidered wool jerseys with front&nbsp;<br>
								(chicken-leg) pockets, you can do so. Niche&nbsp;<br>
								clothing marketers will cater to your every wooly&nbsp;<br>
								whim.&nbsp;</p>
							<p>Seventies shoes were pointy-toed Italian&nbsp;<br>
								things that fit only this one guy in Venice who&rsquo;d&nbsp;<br>
								already quit riding. Unless you had cheap,&nbsp;<br>
								crummy Detto Pietros or expensive Sidis, you&nbsp;<br>
								paid an impatient shoe repairman to nail cleats&nbsp;<br>
								to your shoe soles, then re-nail them and RE-re-&nbsp;<br>
								nail them, glaring at you all the while.&nbsp;</p>
							<p>There was as much to know about shoes then&nbsp;<br>
								as there is to know about Windows today &#151; but&nbsp;<br>
								no one would pay you to learn it. Knowing it&nbsp;<br>
								didn&rsquo;t guarantee you foot comfort, either. You&nbsp;<br>
								suffered anyway.&nbsp;</p>
							<p>Crummy, inaccurate cyclometers clicked every&nbsp;<br>
								time the front wheel revolved. You couldn&rsquo;t&nbsp;<br>
								mount some tires onto some rims without brute&nbsp;<br>
								force. Or the tires went on easily, then blew off&nbsp;<br>
								the rims when you parked your bike in direct&nbsp;<br>
								sunlight.&nbsp;</p>
							<p>Don&rsquo;t get me started about saddles. If you&nbsp;<br>
								want a &rsquo;70s seat for some perverse reason, you&nbsp;<br>
								can still buy one. Or you can choose from 100s&nbsp;<br>
								of current designs.&nbsp;</p>
							<p>In the old days, we were encouraged to&nbsp;<br>
								dismantle our bikes frequently for maintenance,&nbsp;<br>
								sometimes at ludicrous, compulsive-obsessive&nbsp;<br>
								intervals.&nbsp;</p>
							<p>We used to have to remove inner brake&nbsp;<br>
								cables once a year and smear grease on them&nbsp;<br>
								to keep them from rusting inside the housings.&nbsp;<br>
								Now we have nylon-lined housing and rust-proof&nbsp;<br>
								cables. No fuss.&nbsp;</p>
							<p>Back then, you had to maintain top-level parts&nbsp;<br>
								nearly as often as cheap ones. Cheap parts&nbsp;<br>
								were dramatically inferior to today&rsquo;s cheap&nbsp;<br>
								pieces, some of which work as well and last&nbsp;<br>
								nearly as long as today&rsquo;s best stuff.&nbsp;</p>
							<p>You can still fuss if you want, dismantling,&nbsp;<br>
								grease-packing and hand-washing, but you&nbsp;<br>
								don&rsquo;t have to. We&rsquo;re free at last.&nbsp;</p>
							<p>Today you can take organized, professional&nbsp;<br>
								cycling tours all over the world. You can pick&nbsp;<br>
								and choose your tour company; there are&nbsp;<br>
								dozens. You can choose from dozens of cycling&nbsp;<br>
								training camps all over the world: Florida,&nbsp;<br>
								Majorca, Tuscany, Colorado, California...&nbsp;</p>
							<p>You can read hundreds of books about&nbsp;<br>
								cycling. You can watch hundreds of videos. You&nbsp;<br>
								can learn about cycling on-line. You can read&nbsp;<br>
								dozens of cycling periodicals, many of them&nbsp;<br>
								free.&nbsp;</p>
							<p>You can learn more in an hour than you&nbsp;<br>
								could&rsquo;ve reading 12 issues of Bicycling Maga-&nbsp;<br>
								zine or Bike World in 1978.&nbsp;</p>
							<p>Cycling is no longer a cult of true believers&nbsp;<br>
								and freaks. There&rsquo;s no initiation, no hazing. You&nbsp;<br>
								don&rsquo;t have to be a mechanic or wear geeky&nbsp;<br>
								clothes. You don&rsquo;t have to speak French or be&nbsp;<br>
								an expert in the care and preservation of wool&nbsp;<br>
								and leather.&nbsp;</p>
							<p>Cycling today does not demand a life&nbsp;<br>
								commitment. It&rsquo;s fun for nearly everyone.&nbsp;<br>
								I&rsquo;m not saying everything about road cycling is&nbsp;<br>
								fun. Sharing the road with cars is not fun; not&nbsp;<br>
								often anyway, but it never was.&nbsp;</p>
							<p>Dealing with self-absorbed bike shop&nbsp;<br>
								employees is not fun, but you can choose&nbsp;<br>
								among shops or buy mail-order or on-line from&nbsp;<br>
								some pretty cool outfits. You have alternatives.&nbsp;<br>
								In the &rsquo;70s, if you were lucky you had one&nbsp;<br>
								good local shop. If they liked you, meaning if&nbsp;<br>
								you passed their mysterious coolness tests, you&nbsp;<br>
								were in. If, for whatever reason, you did not&nbsp;<br>
								pass - you were out in the cold. Not fun.&nbsp;</p>
							<p>It surely wouldn&rsquo;t have been fun if you were a&nbsp;<br>
								woman, and not a racer. There was no Olympic&nbsp;<br>
								road race for women until 1984, remember.&nbsp;<br>
								Many old school cyclists and coaches failed to&nbsp;<br>
								appreciate females who rode.&nbsp;</p>
							<p>Shops today are used to women customers.&nbsp;<br>
								The employees aren&rsquo;t all adept at helping them&nbsp;<br>
								but at least they aren&rsquo;t blown away when a&nbsp;<br>
								woman walks into the store...or a guy whose&nbsp;<br>
								legs aren&rsquo;t shaved or who asks uninformed&nbsp;<br>
								questions.&nbsp;</p>
							<p>The retail environment isn&rsquo;t perfect, but it&rsquo;s not&nbsp;<br>
								the old boys&rsquo; club it was.&nbsp;</p>
							<p>Bike clubs are better. The racer/tourist splits in&nbsp;<br>
								many clubs have healed. As the average age of&nbsp;<br>
								club cyclists rises, perhaps fewer are as hard-&nbsp;<br>
								core as they were. Clubs have graded rides and&nbsp;<br>
								clubs-within-clubs.&nbsp;</p>
							<p>The &rsquo;70s are gone, but you can act as if they&nbsp;<br>
								aren&rsquo;t. You can wear wool shorts or a leather&nbsp;<br>
								hairnet-style &ldquo;helmet.&rdquo; You can hang out with&nbsp;<br>
								guys who know part numbers for Campag pump&nbsp;<br>
								hangers.&nbsp;</p>
							<p>You can learn French and read L&rsquo;Equipe. You&nbsp;<br>
								can choose clips &lsquo;n straps and spoked, handbuilt&nbsp;<br>
								wheels. You can shift clicklessly and let your&nbsp;<br>
								brake cables wave in the wind.&nbsp;</p>
							<p>Unlike the &rsquo;70s, you don&rsquo;t have to if you don&rsquo;t&nbsp;<br>
								want to.&nbsp;</p>
							<p>Most significantly, you can&rsquo;t go for a ride in the&nbsp;<br>
								&rsquo;70s. You CAN go for a ride today. Today&rsquo;s the&nbsp;<br>
								best day.&nbsp;<br>
