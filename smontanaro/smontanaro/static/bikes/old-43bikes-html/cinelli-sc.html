are just tuning in. Cino Cinelli 19JH-199&amp;* was one of the greatest to create bicycles.							<p>Ironing out a Cinelli timeline is surprisingly difficult - maybe it's best to accept that the date of a Cinelli bike or part from the 1950s and 60s won't ever be definitive. &quot;Open questions&quot; as Cinelli buff Mike Kone called them.</p>							<p>The serial numbers up until 1981 reveal nothing of the date, nor of apparently anything else. And Cinelli often had a big lag between introducing something and production of it, plus overlaps on the bikes going out the door as old supplies got used up. Andrea Cinelli said the type of headbadge (for example) doesn't accurately date a bike at all.</p>							<p>Many of the dates given in published articles have been contested on the <a href="http://www.bikelist.org/mailman/listinfo/classicrendezvoushttp://www.bikelist.org/mailman/listinfo/classicrendezvous">CR list</a> and elsewhere such as in Gabe Konrad's <a title="cinelli history- gabe conrad" href="http://www.bicycletrader.com/archives/13articles.html" target="_blank">article</a> and even &quot;<a title="La Storia" href="http://www.petry.org/markp/lastoria.htm" target="_blank">La Storia</a>&quot; from Cinelli.<br>								<img src="../../43bikes%20drafts/cin-sc%20web/earliest-sc.jpg" alt="" height="113" width="185" border="0"></p>							<p>The 1960-65 period is important because it encompasses the 1a stem and aluminum bars, the bivalent hubs, the smaller badge, the 74mm bb shell going to 70mm and losing the oil ports, losing the ears on the lugs, the unicanitor, the cranks, and many other projects for hour records and such.

They were produced in small quantities (750 in the best years) till the company was sold to A.L. Columbo group in the late 70's. Cinelli frames made up until that point where used used mainly for Olympic and World Championship teams.<br>							<br>							Cino Cinelli was a successful bicycle racer in Italy, winning Milan-San Remo in 1943 and. He started using some of the ideas he had created in his head during those year s of racing, when he began building frames after Word War II. Cinelli thought that frames needed to be stiffer and that the geometry was to relaxed on most of the models of that era. He created a fork crown that had sloping shoulders and internal lugs. This allowed the blades to be shorter and created a stiffer fork . Cinelli also redesigned the seat collar, bring the seatstays in behind the lug rather that along side it. Fausto Coppi was one of the first to use these new features when he raced on a Cinelli frame in 1947.<br>							<br>							Cinelli also was known for components, his steel stems and bars where classic. There where a number of innovations that he brought to cycling. The first clipless pedal, the M71 was released in 1971. The first aluminum handlebars to be accepted by the pros. The first plastic saddle, the Unicantor was designed in 1962 and became the model which all of todays saddles are based.<br>							<br>							Hub design was an area that Cinelli put his trademark on with the introduction of the Bivalent q/r hubs. This design left the freewheel behind in the frame, and the wheel could be used in the front or rear. The idea was ahead of it's time, and the cost which was about twice what a Campagnolo hub would cost.<br>							<br>							Cinelli also created the Laser bicycle which was one of the first aero &ldquo;funny&rdquo; bikes. This model was used to win many national and world titles. Ole Ritter used a Cinelli to set the hour record in 1968. This model had longer cranks and Campagnolo hubs that were 2 cm. narrower than conventional hubs. This bike ran on special tubulars made just for this record attempt. The bike also had a special fork with winged shaped blades for lower wind resistance.<br>							<br>							In Italy the professional racers have a special attachment to Cino Cinelli. The relationship developed between Cino, Gino Bartali and Fausto Coppi.&nbsp; Cino was the foundation of the Italian Professional Cycling Association for professional riders. The idea was to represent the riders interest in the Italian Bicycling Federation, as well as the Italian Sports Federation (CONI). Cino was the president of the association for 24 years. &nbsp;His book on training for cycling remains a classic to this day.<br>							<br>							Cinelli serial numbers do not run in sequence.&nbsp; Only in the post - 1981 timeframe (corresponding to the sale of the company to A.L. Columbo) do the serial numbers indicate the date.&nbsp; Some frames may have sat unsold for years in the shop, others may have been built by subcontractors.&nbsp;<br>							<br>							The key to dating a Cinelli is the lugs (3 holes or no hole) and the bottom bracket oil port.&nbsp; The presence or absence of these features will help to establish the manufacturing date of a Cinelli frame.&nbsp;<br>							<br>							The BB port disappeared in about 1965.&nbsp; The 3 holes in the lugs appeared in about 1968.&nbsp; The Special Corsa (&quot;A&quot; model) is distinguished by its sloping fork crown, where the &quot;B&quot; model has a conventional flat fork crown.&nbsp; The &quot;C&quot; model is known as the &quot;Riviera&quot;.&nbsp; There may have been a factory lightweight model, featuring a milled BB - 3 such bikes are known.&nbsp; There was also a &quot;Laser&quot; aerodynamic / time trial bike offered in limited numbers in the mid-80s.<br>						</font></td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td width="709">						<table border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="1" align="left">							<tr>								<td>									<div align="center">										<font size="-1">By the way, the hubs were NOT patented by Cino; they were designed by the father of a racer named Petrosemolo and the Italian National cycling team coach Rimedio. Andrea also confirms that the 1/A stem (made out of solid aluminum) was shown/used at the Rome Olympics in 1960, but that an industrial production was not up and running for quite a few years thereafter. He was a bit less sure about the bars but did seem to recall them being concurrent with the stem. He does not remember the 74 mm width BB at all. Lastly for the badges, he said they were used in a rather haphazard way and it is therefore completely impossible to date frames by simply using badge size.</font></div>								</td>							</tr>						</table>					</td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td width="709">						<div align="center">							<font size="-1">Mike Kone in 1997</font>							<p><font size="-1">Among the most sought-after of all vintage lightweights. A few heretics claim they are over rated. I say take a closer look and get a clue - or buy a Cannondale. Many Cinelli frames show exquisite mitering, smooth and even brazing, and lots of lug thinning. This is even true for many examples from the early 50's! Sure they have deep ugly file marks too - but that is only the surface! Add to the equation that many ride pretty close to perfection - at least as some would define it. Cinelli frames are also a visual feast with Italian style that just won't quit. In Japan, appreciation for Cinelli products is near cult-like. Over the past several years domestic prices have soared for prime examples. A Cinelli is an icon of cycling tradition. Sure, a few Cinelli frames have some lapses here and there - but don't miss the point. Cinelli frames defined the paradigm of a quality racing bike for decades.<br>								</font></p>							<p><font size="-1"> they are at least as good as many of the earlier ones. Apparently either some very good builders from the previous period continued on, or work was contracted to outside builders of considerable talent. These bikes from this period deserve to be classics in their own right. Their geometry is upright, yet the ride is comfortable. These are bikes designed for the fast short distance riding so common in the United States. They, nonetheless, will handle mountain descents with ease as well! <br>								</font></p>							<p><font size="-1">Sometime around 1983 it all ended. The 26.2 sleeved seat lug was replaced with a different cast model that used a 27.2 post. The familiar 3 hole lugs were gone as well. Quality during the following years took a pretty heavy hit as well. Many examples didn't even have chrome lugs. By the late 80's quality improved and chrome lugs returned.
