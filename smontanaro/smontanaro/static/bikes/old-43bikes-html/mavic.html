The history of Mavic is fascinating, starting with the small outfit making mudguards in 1930 through their huge strides made in racing and innovation every decade since. Though a small, family business most of that time, their role in racing and innovation has been gigantic.

For now there's only a small fan base of people like me with a fetish for these parts, so they are usually cheaper than the Campagnolo equivalent.
